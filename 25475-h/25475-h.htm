	<h2 class="title">THE PLAGUE AT CONSTANTINOPLE.</h2>
	<p class="byline">BY AN EYE-WITNESS.</p>
<p><span class="first_word">In</span> 1837 I was a resident in Galata, one of the faubourgs of Constantinople,
sufficiently near the scenes of death caused by the ravages of
the plague to be thoroughly acquainted with them, and yet to be separated
from the Turkish part of the population of that immense city.
It is not material to the present sketch to dwell upon the subject of my
previous life, or the causes which had induced me to visit the capital of
the East at such a period of mortality; and I will therefore only add,
that circumstances of a peculiarly painful nature obliged me to locate
myself in Galata, where there were none to sympathize in my feelings,
or any one with whom I could even exchange more than a word of conversation.
I saw none but the widowed owner of the house in which I
had a chamber, her daughter Aleuk√¢, and Petraki, her little son.</p>

<p>While the epidemic raged, we four endeavored to keep up a rigid
quarantine. Each recommended to the other the strictest observance of
our mutual agreement not to receive any thing from without doors, except
the necessaries of life; and whenever we left the house, which was
to be as seldom as possible, not to come in contact with any one. Whenever
I went out I invariably wore an oil-cloth cloak, and by the aid of
my cane prevented the dogs of the streets, which are there so numerous,
from rubbing against me. If I visited any one, which I seldom did, I
always sat on a bench or chair to prevent conveying or receiving contagion;
and before even entering the house, I always underwent the
preparation of being smoked in a box, which during the prevalence of
the plague is placed near its entrance for that purpose. These boxes
were some eight feet high by three square, the platform on which the
feet rested elevated about a foot above the earth, so as to admit under it
a dish containing the ingredients of the prophylactic, and a hole in the
door to let the face out during the smoking of the clothes and body.
We procured our daily supply of provisions from a <em>Bak-kal</em>, a retail
grocer, whose shop was directly under our front window; an itinerant
<em>Ekmekjer</em>, or bread-man, brought our bread to the door; our vegetables
were procured from a gardener close by, and our water we drew from a
<a class="pagenum" id="page512" title="512">&nbsp;</a>cistern under the house: in fine, our food was either smoked or saturated
before we touched it, and every possible precaution observed to cut our
little family off from the dreadful scourge, &#8216;the pestilence which walketh
in darkness and the destruction which wasteth at noon day.&#8217; The mother
and daughter throughout the day spun silk, knitted woolen suits, or
embroidered kerchiefs for head dresses, called in Romaic <em>fakiolee</em>, and
even to a late hour of the night they frequently continued the same employment,
until the plague prevented the sale of their handiwork, and
their materials were all used up. All day long they would sit upon
the sofa of their little apartment, facing the street, and while their hands
toiled for a subsistence, the widow&#8217;s daughter hummed a plaintive air,
or occasionally broke the silence by conversing with her mother. The
son was yet too young to be of assistance to his desolate mother and
sister, and except when he said his letters to them, spent the day in idleness.
As to my own employment, the dull period of time passed with
them was a blank in my existence; and yet, such is the influence of
past penury and pain, that I now recall them with pleasure.</p>

<p>The weather was generally very warm, and south-west breezes over
the sea of Marmora prevailed. From our highest windows we could
observe sluggish seamen lounging on the decks of their vessels in the
port, afraid to land amid the pestilence. Here and there a vessel strove
against the current of the Bosphorus to gain an anchorage; or would
slowly float down that stream into the open sea, on its way to healthier
and happier Europe. The starving dogs at nightfall would howl dismally,
bewailing the loss of the benevolent hands from which they
usually received their food; the gulls and cormorants floated languidly
over our dwelling, overpowered by the heat; and the dead silence, which
in the afternoon and evenings prevailed, made a most melancholy and
affecting impression on my mind.</p>

<p>The plague that summer, (I may limit the period to three months,)
carried off more than fifty thousand persons. For some time the mortality
amounted to a thousand <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</em>. The number of corpses which
passed the limited range of my window daily increased; and after witnessing
the spectacle for some time, I always insensibly avoided the sight
of the dead, and felt a cold shudder run over my frame whenever the
voice of the priest accompanying the corpses struck my ear. So dreadful
is the malady, so surely contagious, and so mortal, that so soon as
attacked, the unfortunate being is deserted by relatives and friends, and
when dead, two or four porters beside a priest were generally the only
persons who attended the body to the grave. When the deceased is a
Mussulman, he is more frequently attended during his illness, and after
death to his tomb, than if a Christian. With the former, the plague is
a visitation of Providence, from which it is both useless and a sin to
escape, while with the latter not only is it deemed necessary to provide
for one&#8217;s own life, but even to do so at the sacrifice of the dearest friend.
Often I noticed a dead body tied on a plank which a single porter carried
on his back; at other times the object would be concealed within a bag,
and then the grave was a ditch common to all, into which the porter
would shake off his load and return for another. No priest or Imam
there presided over the funeral scene; few or none were the prayers
<a class="pagenum" id="page513" title="513">&nbsp;</a>that were said over the remains: he who but a short week before had
been proud of his strength or condition, or she who in the same short
space of time previous excelled in beauty and grace, there lay confounded
in one neglected, unhonored, and putrefying mass. The air
became impregnated with the effluvia; the houses around the Turkish
cemeteries, which are mostly in the heart of the city, where the dead
are interred, but some three feet beneath the surface, were soon deserted,
their owners dead. The ever-green cypress trees under whose umbrageous
quiet the beautiful children once played, now moaned over
their little graves; and in fine, every one in the deserted city walked
with measured steps, apprehensive of threatening death: awe and consternation
filled the minds of all.</p>

<p>The Sultan&#8217;s own household was not free from the scourge. By some
means it found access to his servants and carried off about fifty of them.
Their bodies were cast into the Bosphorus, and the Sultan fled to another
palace. The ministers of the Sublime Porte suffered severely in their
families; their wives and slaves died off in numbers; and even the minister
of foreign affairs is said to have taken it and narrowly escaped.
Few survived when once attacked, and the chances of recovery were
scarcely worth calculating. And yet among the Mussulmans little or
no precaution was taken; for although by a government order all the
principal offices were provided with fumigatory boxes, they were seldom
used. The Mussulman Sheiks declared that the contagion came from
Heaven, and could only be averted by Almighty power. Yet it was a
well-known fact that cleanliness of habits went far toward preserving
against the disease; and frequent change of apparel, with ordinary precautions,
sufficed to preserve many who otherwise would doubtless have
taken it.</p>

<p>But I think the reader will be able, from the preceding sketch, to
form some idea of the nature and extent of the mortality of the plague
in 1837. While it raged, every feeling approaching to a similarity with
what is known to denote an attack, excites apprehension. A pimple,
through the medium of the imagination, is transformed into a horrid
<em>bubo</em>; a cold or a simple head-ache, however trifling, are attributed to
the dreaded malady; and even the firmest mind at such times quails
under trifling appearances. In some cases the scene of agony closes in
a few hours&#8212;even minutes; they fall down and almost immediately
expire. Others linger for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, or several
days elapse before death puts an end to their sufferings. Some again
bear it in their systems for several days, and attend to their usual occupations:
at length it appears, they fall ill and expire, or recover. Few
account for their being attacked; they do not remember having touched
any one suspected or exposed; and again, the porters, whose duty it is
to convey the attacked to the hospitals and the corpses to their graves,
escape. The mother attends upon her dying child, sacrifices every apprehension
to her affection, and yet escapes, or the child brings it to its
parent, who dies, while the innocent cause survives. No cure has yet
been found for it; and Nature must be left to take her course. Extreme
heat or cold have a favorable effect upon it; but the temperate climate
of Constantinople, with the frequent dearth of water, the dust, and other
impurities, tend greatly to its dissemination.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="page514" title="514">&nbsp;</a>It was therefore during this painful period that I resided in Galata;
free, as I had hoped, from the contagion; and yet it found its way into
our little family, accompanied by all its horrors.</p>

<p>One morning in the latter part of the month of October, invited by the
clearness of the air and a fresh breeze which had scarcely strength sufficient
to ruffle the water of the harbor, I left my humble apartment and
ascended the steep hill of Pera. The view&#8212;from the small tuft of graves
near the Galata tower, some of which were fresh; of the surrounding
villages and the great city itself, where, although devastation had been
and still was being carried on with horror, there seemed to reign the
most perfect tranquility, resembling the calm bosom of the treacherous
sea, quiet over the lifeless bodies of its victims and the wreck of the
noble vessels which had furrowed its surface&#8212;relieved the monotony of
my existence. I gazed longingly upon the many ships lying before
me at anchor in the stream, which could in a few days bear me far
away from the scenes of death and desolation that surrounded me; or
I exchanged a word with any passing acquaintance who ventured from
Pera to his counting-house in Galata. A longer walk gave rise to too
many sad reflections. Farther on was the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit Champ des Morts</em>, a
small Turkish cemetery, here and there spotted with new-made graves,
over which more than one aged female mourned the loss of her life&#8217;s
companion, or perhaps it would be one of fewer years, who wept the
fatal destiny of her young husband, brother, sister, or child.</p>

<p>After spending the best part of the day in walking about, I returned
to the house of my residence. As usual, I found the door fastened; I
knocked, but no one answered me. Again I knocked, and called repeatedly
before my voice was heard. At length a low moan, and then a
scream, issued from within. Petraki, the widow&#8217;s son, opened the door,
and with a pale and frightened countenance told me his mother had suddenly
been taken very ill. There was no alternative. I entered her
sitting-room, where in the company of the family I had spent many
quiet hours. Now how changed! The mother lay upon the sofa, pale;
and breathing with difficulty. Aleuk√¢, the daughter, knelt by her side
on the floor, though greatly agitated herself, and endeavoring to calm
her mother&#8217;s apprehensions. Without once reflecting on the possible
consequences, I sat down on a chair beside the sufferer, felt her pulse,
and as well as I could, made inquiries after her health. Her pulse was
quick, her tongue white and thickly furred, and extreme lassitude was
shown by her dejected countenance. Uncertain as to the nature of her
disease, and unable to offer any alleviation of her sufferings, I retired to
my apartment. There I <em>did</em> reflect on the danger which I had incurred,
and the possibility of the widow having caught the plague.</p>

<p>Every hour she became worse; her sufferings were intensely painful;
and to shorten the recital of the sad scene of that night, I will only add,
that the horrid disease showed itself on her person before midnight, and
at break of day her spirit fled. Of course my mind now prepared for
death. I felt confident that I also should soon be a victim to the plague.
Early in the morning I called a passing priest and had the widow&#8217;s remains
conveyed to their last abode&#8212;I knew not where. I had no place
to fly to; every door would be closed against me; and I retired to my
<a class="pagenum" id="page515" title="515">&nbsp;</a>apartment, feeling that I was stepping into my tomb while yet alive.
There I was not long kept in suspense, for soon the plague attacked
first Petraki then myself. When giddiness, the first symptom of the
plague, seized me, and I could no longer stand, but fell despairingly on
my bed, what were my feelings! But let me not recall them <em>now</em>; the
mental agony which I suffered it is impossible to describe, and I shudder
at the recollection. Aleuk√¢ attended upon me and her brother with all
the tenderness and care and forgetfulness of self which is so characteristic
of the female character. I begged her to leave me to die alone, to
place water by my side and depart, but she would not hear of it.</p>

<p>The first night after his attack Petraki expired, and on the following
morning was borne away; and I have an indistinct recollection of being
visited on the evening of the same day by the priest and porters. They
endeavored to prevail upon Aleuk√¢ to desert me, saying that in a few
hours I would cease to exist. But she constantly refused, determined
she replied, to remain by my side until my sufferings were ended.</p>

<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>For several days I was delirious. I remember I knew of nothing;
nothing but water passed my lips. Sores broke out over my body, and
those on my groins and arm-pits were not closed for some months. My
neck however was free, and this no doubt saved my life. On the seventh
day I regained my senses, and found myself in my apartment, the wasted
figure of my guardian angel still watching over me. I remember, on
perceiving in me a favorable change, how her countenance was lit up
with joy! Oh, Friendship! how seldom are you found with the sincerity
which I then beheld in an humble and uneducated girl! Just
when I thought all my prospects in life were blighted; when I had keenly
felt the unkindness of mankind, and despaired of ever again finding
any thing in this world worth living for; when I had already bidden it
farewell, and the other world was full in view; I found what alone can
make life delightful even in poverty and misfortune&#8212;friendship and
love. Soon the violence of the disease abated, and I was saved.</p>

<p>I must hastily pass over my long and painful convalescence. A
month elapsed before I could venture to go beyond doors. Aleuk√¢ attended
upon me, and through her economy my purse yet held out. The
plague had greatly subsided; the month of December set in with uncommon
severity of cold, and checked its progress. Oh! the exquisite
delight with which I left my hard and burning bed and close apartment,
the scenes of all my sufferings, for the first time! With a prayer of
thankfulness on my lips, I crossed the threshold of the humble dwelling,
and once more slowly mounted the steep hill of Pera.</p>

<p>It was a bright, sunny, clear morning; the fresh, cool breeze from
the Black Sea blew over me, infusing new strength and life into my
shattered frame. The streets were again re-peopled, and business renewed.
No one recognized me in my pale, haggard and swollen countenance;
and when I presented myself at the door of a countryman in
Pera, he drew back with an exclamation of surprise, as if he had beheld
a spirit.</p>

<p>My short story is told. I have comprised in a few words the tale of
many long days of agony and suffering, both mental and corporeal. I
<a class="pagenum" id="page516" title="516">&nbsp;</a>fast regained my strength and vigor; the hollow furrows of my forehead
and cheeks soon gave way to the effects of a generous diet; and I once
more stood forth in health and full powers.</p>

<p>But you will ask, &#8216;And where is she who watched over you during
your moments of suffering?&#8212;whom you called your guardian angel,
and of whose friendship and love you spoke in such feeling terms?&#8217; I
reply, that she sits even now at my side; her handsome and intelligent
countenance reading in my face the varied emotions to which the tracing
of these lines give rise. Devoted Aleuk√¢ is my loving and much-loved
wife.</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page517" title="517">&nbsp;</a>REMINISCENCES OF A DARTMOOR PRISONER.</h2>

	<p class="subtitle">NUMBER THREE.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">Under</span> the circumstances related in my last number, it will readily
	be inferred that sleep was out of the question. The only alternative
	was to sit or lie down and meditate upon the next change which might
	befal us. There was but little disposition for merriment at such a time
	and place; yet there was one man, named John Young, but called by
	his companions &#8216;Old John Young,&#8217; who in despite of empty stomach and
	aching limbs, amused himself and annoyed all others by singing a line
	of one and a verse of another, of all the old songs he could recollect
	from his earliest boyhood; dispensing his croaking melody with such
	untiring zeal as to keep the most weary awake had they been inclined
	to sleep.</p>

	<p>At break of day we began to try to move about, and gradually
	straighten ourselves, which was something of an effort, stiffened and benumbed
	as we were with remaining in our wet clothing so many hours.
	We had now an opportunity of examining our habitation. It was a
	building of about four hundred feet long, by seventy-five or eighty wide,
	three stories high, and built of stone, with massive doors and strongly-grated
	windows, the floors being of stone or cement, and perfectly fire-proof.
	Each floor formed one entire room, except being divided by five
	rows of posts running the whole length of the building, by which the
	prisoners slung their hammocks. The prisoners were divided off in
	&#8216;messes&#8217; or families of six or eight, each occupying room sufficient to
	sit around one of their chests, which usually served as a mess-table.
	One row or tier of these messes were ranged next to the walls on each
	side, and two rows down the centre, back to back, as it were, leaving two
	avenues, or thoroughfares, the whole length of the building. The entire
	arrangement resembled the stalls in a stable, more than any thing
	else I can compare it to.</p>

	<p>There were seven of these prisons, all of about the same size and
	construction, one of which was not occupied. The whole was enclosed
	in a circular wall of about twenty feet high, and covering a space of
	from eight to ten acres of ground. This was divided in three parts by
	a wall similar to the outside one. The centre yard was occupied by
	No. 7, allotted to the colored prisoners, and the other two yards had
	three prisons in each. On the outside wall were platforms and sentry-boxes
	at short distances, for the guards. About fifteen feet within that
	wall was a high iron railing. In front of the main entrance was a large
	square, used for drilling soldiers and other purposes, and twice a week
	as a market for the country people; and on each side of this were the
	barracks and hospital, and in front of these were the officers&#8217; quarters.
	This d√©p√¥t was situated upon a hill, surrounded by a vast common of
	many miles in extent, without a bush or tree to relieve the dreary waste;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page518" title="518">&nbsp;</a>and from its elevated position it was generally shrouded by clouds,
	rendering it chilly and uncomfortable the greater part of the year.</p>

	<p>The daily allowance of food consisted of a pound of beef, a pint of
	soup, and a pound of bread to each man; that is to say, at the rate of
	one hundred pounds of raw beef to an hundred men. The meat was
	cut up and put into large boilers, with sufficient barley to thicken it for
	soup. This was boiled until the meat would leave the bone, and the
	barley was well cooked; and when ready, was served up to the different
	messes. By the time each person got his beef it was almost too small to
	be seen, being shrunk up by long boiling; and the bone being taken
	out, it was no larger than a small-sized tea-cup. The pound of bread
	was not much larger: it was made of barley, slack-baked, and very
	dark, though sweet. Indeed it was good enough, what there was of it.
	On Fridays the fare was varied by the same amount in fish and potatoes.</p>

	<p>As some require more nutriment than others, the same quantity of
	fare did not satisfy all the prisoners alike. I frequently saw many of
	them devour their day&#8217;s allowance at one meal without appeasing their
	hunger; and before the next day&#8217;s rations were served out, they would
	be almost frantic from starvation. Some became so exhausted that they
	were compelled to go to the hospital until they recovered strength.
	Those who possessed a little money fared somewhat better, as they
	could indulge in the luxury of bullock&#8217;s liver, fried in water for the
	want of fat, or a hot pumgudgeon fried in the same material. This exquisite
	dish is not appreciated according to its merits. It commonly
	bears the undignified title of &#8216;codfish-balls;&#8217; and is well known at the
	present day among our eastern brethren, though not held in the same
	veneration by them as clam-chowder. &#8216;Dartmoor pippins,&#8217; or potatoes,
	were also held in high estimation with us.</p>

	<p>Dartmoor prison was a world in miniature, with all its jealousies, envyings
	and strife. How shall I describe the scenes enacted within its
	walls? how portray the character of its inhabitants? If I but held the
	pen of <span class="special_name">Dickens</span> or the pencil of <span class="special_name">Mount</span>, I might hope so to bring the objects
	before the mind&#8217;s eye of the reader, that they would stand forth in
	full relief, inducing him almost to imagine that he stood in their midst.
	Though many years have rolled by since those events occurred, they
	still linger in my memory like the vivid scenes of a high-wrought drama;
	and often in the &#8216;dead waste and middle of the night&#8217; do I revisit
	in my dreams scenes which I should be sorry to survey when awake.</p>

	<p>I think it one of the greatest blessings granted by an all-wise and benevolent
	<span class="special_name">Creator</span>, that He has bestowed upon man an intellectual and
	physical capacity, which enables him to pass in comparative happiness
	many a lonely hour. Many were the a√´rial maps and charts laid down
	for our future journeyings through life, and plans formed, which were
	never to be realized. And perhaps all was for the best; for we are all
	creatures of circumstance. Not one in a thousand follows out his
	plans through life. Half of our existence is imaginary; and wise-acres
	may scoff as much as they please at what they term &#8216;castle-building,&#8217;
	I believe all mankind indulge in it more or less; and it is an
	innocent, harmless pastime, which injures no one. I consider it the &#8216;unwritten
	<a class="pagenum" id="page519" title="519">&nbsp;</a>poetry,&#8217; the romance of life, which all feel; but many, like the
	dumb, strive in vain to give utterance to their thoughts.</p>

	<p>Many of the prisoners busied themselves in making some trifling article,
	which, while it afforded amusement, aided in obtaining for them a
	little money, and thereby added to their comfort. Many of the most ingenious
	specimens of art I ever saw were made there; some of which
	were models of vessels, of various classes, from the clipper-built brig to
	the line-of-battle ship; made too of beef bones, obtained from the cook.
	They were built up precisely like a large vessel; human hair twisted
	into ropes of suitable sizes being employed for rigging. When completed,
	they made a beautiful toy. Desks, work-boxes, etc., were also
	made here; violins, some of which were of excellent tone, were likewise
	constructed. But it would be useless to enumerate the endless variety
	of queer things made at this multifarious manufactory. Some organized
	a music-society, with various instruments, and used occasionally to
	give concerts; others got up a theatre, screening it off with bed covering.
	I recollect some pretty good performances among them. In short,
	all were employed in some way, to divert their minds from the contemplation
	of their miserable condition. Some would read while others listened;
	some practice fencing; some sing, some dance. Others would
	relate their adventures, many of which savored rather too strongly of the
	marvellous to be readily believed, while others partook in an equal degree
	of the ludicrous. One of these latter was related by &#8216;Old John
	Young&#8217;&#8212;a tale of his early courtship. In his youthful days he lived
	somewhere in Pennsylvania, where also resided an old farmer, with his
	wife and two daughters, one of whom, contrary to the old gentleman&#8217;s
	wishes, he used to visit. One night while there, unknown to the old
	people, they having retired, a huge pot of mush was left boiling over the
	fire, getting ready for the next day. Late in the evening the old gentleman
	called out for the girls to go to bed; and as they did not retire
	in time to suit him, he began to stir round, to see why his orders were
	not obeyed. Young, hearing him coming, took off his shoes to prevent
	a noise, and glided silently up a ladder into the loft above. The old
	farmer, having sent the girls to bed, lifted off the boiling pot, which by
	accident he placed at the foot of the ladder; then putting out the light,
	and covering the fire, he retired again to bed. When all was still and
	quiet, Young, with shoes in hand, stole down the ladder, and landed in
	the pot! Although badly burned, he escaped in some degree by having
	his stockings on. He left his tracks on the floor, but got out of the house
	unobserved. He had &#8216;put his foot in it&#8217; in good earnest; and mounting
	his horse, he bade a final adieu to the old farmer and his family.</p>

	<p>Winter was now pretty well advanced, and many suffered for the
	want of clothing. After considerable delay, however, a small portion
	was sparingly dealt out, but was accepted by those only who stood in
	the utmost need. The cause was, that the agent or contractor, having
	a quantity of garments on hand, over what had been a sufficient supply
	for some English convicts, who had been confined here at some former
	period, they were now offered to us, but were rejected by all who could do
	without them. Those who did receive them, cut a curious figure! I
	can almost imagine one standing before me now, dressed in a jacket and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page520" title="520">&nbsp;</a>trowsers of bright yellow cloth; and as they were served out indiscriminately,
	the consequence was, that large stalwart men were crammed
	into trowsers which looked more like breeches, and jackets with sleeves
	terminating at the elbows; and small men with jackets, the sleeves of
	which dangled far below the hands, and an extra length of pantaloons
	turned up to the knees; the whole figure surmounted by a knit-woollen
	cap, resembling an inverted wash-basin; coarse brogans completed the
	costume. Just pause a moment, reader, and contemplate the figure!</p>

	<p>What with starving and freezing, many became ill, and had to be
	removed to the hospital. This was what all dreaded; and the consequence
	was, they were so far gone before they went, that they survived
	but a short time after getting there, although it was understood that the
	physician was a skilful and humane man, and did all in his power to
	alleviate their distress. I was taken very ill with the dysentery. I
	know of no disease which brings a man down more rapidly. Two or
	three days weakened me so much that I could scarcely move; and with
	it came a despondency of mind that was almost insupportable. I had
	been for years a wayfarer in strange lands, but never, during the whole
	time, did I so forcibly feel the want of a home, and the solace and care
	of friends, as now. How did I long to be once more under my father&#8217;s
	roof, with an affectionate mother and kind sister! I had a sad forboding
	that I should soon be numbered among the multitude whose spirits
	had ascended from their prison-house, and whose bodies were deposited
	outside the walls, in the ground assigned for that purpose.</p>

	<p>The small-pox had also appeared in our midst, spreading havoc on
	all sides; and despair seemed to rule triumphant. Of those who left for
	the hospital, but few returned to their comrades. Among those taken
	ill, was a young man who had been brought up on a farm. Like
	many others, he had left home to &#8216;go a-privateering,&#8217; and was taken
	prisoner. He never saw home again. He messed just opposite to me,
	and was I think one of the most exquisite amateur performers on the
	violin that I ever heard. For hours have I listened with rapture to his
	delightful music. He was absent a day, and his instrument was silent.
	The next day I enquired for him; he had been taken suddenly ill, was
	removed to the hospital, and the second evening brought me tidings of
	his death. There was another one, who had been for weeks sullen and
	gloomy. Despair seemed to have thrown its pall over him. He conversed
	with none, but shunning his companions, spent the day muttering
	to himself. Early one morning he was discovered in a secluded part
	of the prison, cold and stiff. He had hung himself.</p>

	<p>And was there no one to look after the spiritual or temporal welfare
	of this mass of isolated beings? Was there none to soothe the troubled
	mind, to cheer the drooping spirit, nor to whisper hope in the ear of the
	desponding? Was there none of God&#8217;s &#8216;messengers of glad tidings&#8217; to
	offer consolation to the dying, and a prayer for mercy on the departing
	spirit of his suffering fellow-being? No; not one minister of the gospel,
	of any denomination, did I see while I was there; nor did I hear of
	any having been there, at any time; nor was there any person to see
	that the prisoners had suitable beds and clothing, or that their food was
	wholesome, during the many months that I was there. I was told that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page521" title="521">&nbsp;</a><span class="special_name">Reuben G. Beasly</span>, who was appointed by our government, and who received
	its pay to see to American interests, had been there some months
	before, but had done nothing for them; and to the letters of remonstrance
	written to him, stating their wants, their insufficiency of food and clothing,
	etc., he turned a deaf ear. He did not deign a reply to them; and
	what more could be expected of a man who could be so base as to do
	what I will here state?</p>

	<p>About three years ago I met an old ship-mate. We went to India in
	the same ship. He held a midshipman&#8217;s warrant in the United States&#8217;
	navy, and went out on this voyage for practice in seamanship. He was
	made prisoner at the same time I was. In the shiftings and changes
	which took place, we were separated; and when I saw him, several
	years after, he stated that after parting with me he remained in London,
	endeavoring in vain to get employment on board some ship; that becoming
	destitute, he went to Mr. Beasly, (<em>Beastly</em> it should be,) to get
	advice and assistance, stating who and what he was; and that, in consequence
	of the unsettled mode of life in which he had been living, he
	had unfortunately lost his warrant; and urged him, as an act of humanity,
	to point out some method whereby he might help himself. He turned
	away from him with indifference, saying he could do nothing for him.
	After a lapse of several days, finding no hope of extricating himself
	from his embarrassed situation, as a last resource he went once more to
	Mr. Beasly, and asked assistance. The reply was: &#8216;Be off! and if you
	trouble me again I will put you on board of an English man-of-war!&#8217;
	This gentleman<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="Stephen B. Wilson, Esq." class="fnmarker">1</a> is now Lieutenant Commandant in our navy. He
	told me he had seen Mr. Beasly not long before, in his official capacity
	as consul at Havre, but did not make himself known to him. Is it not
	strange, that one who was so regardless of the duties of his office and the
	feelings of humanity should hold so lucrative and responsible a situation
	as the one which he enjoys to this day? There have been serious
	complaints made against him, within a year or two, by several respectable
	captains of vessels.</p>

	<p>The number of prisoners on my arrival at the d√©p√¥t I understood to
	amount to about three thousand; notwithstanding the deaths had gradually
	increased, the number was kept good by detachments sent in from
	time to time, many of them from English ships of war, who had been
	impressed into the service; and although they had frequently asked for
	a discharge, they could not get it until the European war had ended,
	and there was but little farther use for them. But they obtained their
	dismissal, and with it the pay and prize-money due to them at the
	time.</p>

	<p>Such occasions afforded a kind of jubilee, as the money they brought
	was soon put in circulation through the prisons, from whence it speedily
	evaporated, being spent in provisions, vegetables, and fruits, brought
	there by the country-people for sale, and for which an enormous price
	was paid. Many of the men thus delivered up, had spent several years
	of the prime of life in fighting the battles of a foreign nation, and were
	then dismissed with the most brutal treatment. As an instance: a man
	<a class="pagenum" id="page522" title="522">&nbsp;</a>by the name of <span class="special_name">Slater</span>, a tall, robust man, just such an one as they
	like to get hold of, in the service where he had been several years, had
	made frequent but unavailing applications for a discharge. At length
	when the war broke out, he made more urgent solicitations for a release.
	The answer was, &#8216;Yes, you shall have it; but we will first give you
	something to remember us by.&#8217; And tying him up, they gave him three
	dozen lashes, and sent him to Dartmoor. Such was the reward of his
	services!</p>

	<h2 class="title">MARY MAY: THE NEWFOUNDLAND INDIAN.</h2>

	<p class="byline">BY A NEW CONTRIBUTOR.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> tribe of aborigines to which <span class="special_name">Mary May</span>, the heroine of our little
	sketch, belonged, has been named by the Newfoundlanders, &#8216;Red Indians;&#8217;
	for what reason, I could never learn. This tribe, or probably
	the miserable remnant of it, since the English have settled the island
	has been regarded as altogether remarkable and undefinable. They
	have never, in a single instance, been induced to visit the white settler
	since British subjects have resided there. Little is known of their numbers,
	habits, or general spirit, although the most sedulous exertions have
	been made to bring about an amicable understanding and a reciprocal
	intercourse. They have chosen to remain isolated and insolated; keeping
	their history, their wisdom, and their deeds to themselves. They will
	hold no communion with others of their own race. There are the Esquimaux,
	very near their northern boundary; a people disposed to extend
	the rites of hospitality in peace, and a trading tribe; but these
	have no more knowledge of the &#8216;Red Indian&#8217; than the white man; and
	they remain wrapt up in a historical mantle as dark as the shades of
	their own impenetrable complexion.</p>

	<p>Much, of a marvellous character, has been said about the Red Indians.
	The fishermen of the island, as a mass, believe that these poor creatures
	are semi-human. They will tell you of their having been seen one moment
	cooking their venison, and composedly regaling themselves, and
	the next, upon learning the contiguity of the white man, they would
	vanish from sight, and not a trace could be found of their departure;
	that they descend far under ground in winter, and lead a kind of fairy
	life; that they have power to change themselves into birds and fishes,
	and to sustain life for hours together under water. But all this is of
	course unnatural and absurd. The Indians of Newfoundland are flesh
	and blood, and partake, in common with other races of rational beings,
	of properties holding them within &#8216;delegated limits of power.&#8217; And in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page524" title="524">&nbsp;</a>my opinion, they are as much entitled to a character of consistency as
	the generality of tribes on our continent. The secret of their shyness,
	and their unsocial and vindictive disposition, may better be accounted
	for, from the probable fact that they were inhumanly treated by the early
	discoverers of the island, the Portuguese and Spaniards. These monsters
	without doubt butchered and made havock of these poor natives
	as they did the South American Indians, and indeed wherever their lawless
	adventures led them, in this new world.</p>

	<p>Various governors have been appointed to the Newfoundland station
	since Great-Britain has possessed the island, and all have used more
	than ordinary means to reach the Red Indians, and reconcile them to
	the pale-faces, who have taken possession of the bays and harbors of
	their bold and rugged coast. The last, of any magnitude, that was
	made, was during the summer of 1830, and immediately preceding the
	administration of Sir Thomas Cochran. It consisted of a regular exploring
	expedition, numbering about fifty persons, a part of whom were
	regular soldiers, and a part volunteer citizens, which left St. John&#8217;s, the
	capital of the island, with instructions to explore the interior, and traverse
	every portion of it in quest of the Indians, and to bring some back
	with them; but to use no cruelty, unless absolutely necessary. After
	traversing the internal wilds for some ten days, the expedition discovered
	smoke in the distance, and in a few hours came upon a party of Indians
	in their wigwams. The red men were greatly surprised, and appeared
	much alarmed. But upon being presented with some showy ornaments,
	accompanied by smiles, and other friendly indications, their fears somewhat
	subsided, and two of them became apparently willing to accompany
	the expedition into St. John&#8217;s, on learning by signs that two of the white
	men would remain as guarantees of their good treatment and return.
	The white men left were supplied with a large quantity of ornaments
	and trinkets to distribute among other Indians whom they might find
	during the absence of their party, a period which was not to be prolonged
	beyond a month. The good-bye was given, and the expedition
	started on their return home. It had not travelled many hours before
	an uncontrollable disposition seized them to go back again to the spot of
	separation to see if all was well, for some declared that they had a presentiment
	that there had already been foul play. Back they went, and
	when they reached the spot where good wishes had just been interchanged,
	the first spectacle which met their eyes was the mutilated dead
	bodies of their faithful hostages! Without any consultation, or a moment&#8217;s
	delay, the commander of the expedition ordered the two Indians
	in their keeping to be shot, and their bodies left exposed, as they had
	found those of their comrades. This order was promptly executed.</p>

	<p>Soon after Sir Thomas Cochran was appointed governor of Newfoundland,
	he offered a reward of one hundred pounds for the harmless
	capture of a Red Indian, the person to be brought him at the capital.
	This reward was advertised in the summer of 1832; and the next
	spring a fisherman, at a distant, unfrequented part of the island, saw on
	a pleasant afternoon a young female Indian, laving at the edge of the
	water. She was alone, and unconscious of danger, and went through
	the offices of the bath with singular grace and activity. After watching
	<a class="pagenum" id="page525" title="525">&nbsp;</a>her for some time, he took his measures for her capture. He first cut
	off her retreat, then approached her carefully, and at the instant of surprise,
	obtained possession of her person. She made no resistance, but
	acted as one paralyzed by fear or wonder. He brought her to Sir
	Thomas, and received his reward. It being the month of May when
	she was captured, she was given the name of <span class="special_name">Mary May</span>. She was
	apparently about eighteen years of age; an angelic creature, tall, with
	perfect symetry of proportion, agreeable features, good complexion, and
	as agile and graceful as a fawn. The governor and the officers of the
	garrison, and the √©lite of St. Johns, vied with each other in plans and
	devices for her gratification. She was taken to parties, to the theatre,
	to military reviews; in short, she was flattered, caressed, and made the
	reigning belle. But the poor Indian showed an almost blank indifference
	to the various schemes devised for her pleasure. She was not <em>at home</em>.
	Every face, every habit, every object was new, and appeared strange
	to her. She undoubtedly pined to go back again into the dark wilds
	among her own people. Perhaps her heart, that wonderful controller
	of human destiny, was in the keeping of some extolled brave: at all
	events, it was not in the scenes that were passing before her; and the
	efforts so generously put forth for her amusement and happiness were
	like the crystal droppings upon the hard insensible stone, falling in full
	profusion, but leaving no impress.</p>

	<p>Mary was detained about a year, and was then given in charge of the
	fisherman who captured her, with express directions that she should be
	taken to the spot where he found her, and there be left to her own guidance.
	She was richly clad and profusely decorated before she was
	given her liberty, and was furnished with a large quantity of finery for
	distribution among the members of her tribe. It was hoped that this
	treatment, when communicated by one of their own blood, would cause
	a change of feeling among the Red Indians, and that gradually a reciprocity
	of confidence and intercourse would be established. But this experiment
	and this hope proved futile and delusive. In 1836 I left the
	island of Newfoundland, and up to that time not a glimpse of the red
	race had flitted across the vision of civilization since the dark captive
	was permitted again to bound over hill and dale without let or hindrance.
	Many idle reports and tales were circulated about Mary May, after meeting
	with her tribe; but little reliance is placed upon them, as they are for
	the most part contradictory, and strongly savor of the marvellous. But
	I will give the reader one, which is as well authenticated as any, and
	quite as probable.</p>

	<p>On the second day after Mary was liberated, she found a portion of
	her people; and when they first saw her, they were much alarmed,
	judging from her fanciful, brilliant habiliments that she was some celestial
	visiter. But hearing their own language addressed to them, the
	parentage of the girl, and the cause of her absence, they became gradually
	calm, and curiosity took the place of fear, and this gave place to
	admiration, until the lost one was fairly constituted by acclamation a
	goddess, and to her surprise and grief, worshiped as such! The daughter&#8217;s
	return had been communicated to the father, with such exaggerations
	and extravagances as pertain to the grossly superstitious; and he,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page526" title="526">&nbsp;</a>instead of falling upon his child&#8217;s neck, and receiving her as the lost
	found, came bowing and doing reverence and worship. Mary was bewildered,
	and almost wished herself back again with the pale-faces.</p>

	<p>But there was one link in the chain of her destiny yet to be proved;
	if <em>that</em> should be found true, she had not returned in vain. About a
	year previous to her capture, on a sunny afternoon, she had strayed a
	mile or two from her father&#8217;s camp, invited partly by the romance of
	her own nature, and partly by the novelty of new scenery, opened up by
	a change of camping-ground. While hesitating concerning her return,
	and gracefully leaning against a young sapling, she heard a rustling of
	leaves near her; and quickly directing her eyes to the spot whence the
	alarm came, she saw with terror a full-grown panther steadily and cautiously
	approaching her. She had no weapon of defence, and Indian
	though she was, had never participated in blood and strife. She knew
	that flight would be vain, for what human being could outrun a hungry
	panther? She raised one alarm-whoop, and awaited her fate. At the
	loud, piercing cry, the fierce animal seemed alarmed in his turn, and
	paused in his progress. But after some five minutes, he recovered his
	courage, and was making ready for the fatal spring, when an arrow
	pierced his heart; and the next moment a young, athletic brave sprang
	from the thicket, and clasped the dark damsel to his breast. She remained
	an instant, passive and bewildered; the next, she sprang from
	the embrace of the stranger, and with Indian dignity thanked him for
	his kind and timely aid. She then turned her face toward her father&#8217;s
	camp, and with the fleetness of an antelope passed the intervening space,
	and soon found herself safe in her changing habitation.</p>

	<p>But notwithstanding the assumed dignity and apparent coldness with
	which she addressed the young stranger, Mary in that moment of rescue
	was awakened to a new and impassioned existence. The image
	of the stranger was before her by day and in her dreams by night. Six
	or eight months passed, when the chiefs of the tribe celebrated a great
	festival, to which all the members were invited. The ceremonies were
	to last a week; many did not arrive until after the first day, and the
	father of Mary, and his camp, were of this number. But toward the
	evening of the first day of the festivities, a tall, graceful young brave
	stalked into the assembly, and with cool solicitude scanned the faces of
	the female visiters; and not appearing satisfied, he folded his arms upon
	his breast, and leaning against a rude post, listlessly observed the
	sports. But a close observer would have seen his eye lit up with unwonted
	interest when any new arrival was announced. No one knew
	him; his dress was peculiar; still he spoke their language, and the old
	chiefs passed him by for a future examination.</p>

	<p>On the second day of the gathering, toward noon, Mary May arrived,
	and with her father, mother and sisters, entered that enclosure of merry
	hearts. She hoped to see at the festival the youth who had so strongly
	impressed her; and the moment she entered the rude structure, her
	eyes eagerly ranged round the assembly until they rested upon the person
	of her rescuer, who as eagerly returned her significant glance.
	During the continuance of the feast and frolic, the lovers had many interviews;
	and before it closed, their faith and vows were exchanged.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page527" title="527">&nbsp;</a>They were to have been married the month after her capture; and
	now, since her return and deification, she had not learned a word about
	her &#8216;brave,&#8217; and had come to the determination if he proved false to
	destroy herself. Day after day passed without the presence of the only
	one who could drive the dark cloud from her mind, and it was becoming
	every day more dense and oppressive, until she gave way to utter despondency,
	and bitterly bewailed her fate. One afternoon, about two
	months after her return, while some of her kindred were bowing before
	her in heathenish worship, hasty steps were heard approaching; the
	next moment the young brave appeared and clasped his lost treasure to
	his heart; and taking advantage of the bewilderment of the worshippers,
	occasioned by his sudden appearance, the happy pair escaped to the sea-coast,
	and passing over a portion of the bay, found a secure retreat
	among the Mickmacs, to which tribe the young brave belonged.</p>

	<p>And there may they rest. I sometimes, though quite infrequently, meet
	with some one from Newfoundland; and among the first questions I
	ask is one touching the &#8216;Red Indians;&#8217; and although I have not heard
	any thing which went to confirm the hope that they may yet be brought
	to place confidence in the white man, yet I still trust that I shall; and
	when this result is brought about, or any other thing of interest shall
	be learned of these strange mortals, I shall take much pleasure in communicating
	the information, for the benefit of the readers of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>.</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page529" title="529">&nbsp;</a>THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

	<h3 class="subtitle fancy">Harry Harson.</h3>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h4>

	<p><span class="first_word">On</span> the day but one after Rust&#8217;s death, Mr. Kornicker was very busy
	in his office. His coat was off; his hat was on a chair, and in it was
	his snuff-box, a black silk neckcloth, and a white handkerchief, not a
	little discolored by the presence of snuff and the absence of water. In
	one corner of the room lay a confused heap, consisting of bed, bedding,
	and various odds and ends of wearing apparel; and from these Mr.
	Kornicker, after due reflection and calculation as to the order in which
	to make his choice, selected article after article. First, he spread upon
	the floor his counterpane, then his blanket, then a sheet not a little akin
	in appearance to his handkerchief, and then his bed: upon these he
	piled his apparel, in a confused heap, and proceeded to roll the whole
	into a large ball, which he secured with a piece of rope. &#8216;Now then,
	the moving&#8217;s begun,&#8217; said he, opening the door and rolling the bundle
	into the entry. &#8216;The premises are ready for the next tenant.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Having brushed his knees with the palm of his hands, and then dusted
	his hands by knocking them together, he put on his neckcloth, coat, and
	hat; pocketed his snuff-box and handkerchief, walked into the entry,
	locked the door, put the key over it, as he had always been in the habit
	of doing; seated himself upon his bundle, with his back leaning against
	the wall; and immediately lapsed into a fit of deep abstraction, which
	he occasionally relieved by kicking his heels against the floor, shaking
	his head, in a sudden and emphatic manner, or inhaling his breath rapidly
	and violently, producing a sound blending the harmonious qualities of
	a snort and a whistle.</p>

	<p>&#8216;So,&#8217; said he, after indulging in one of the last mentioned performances
	with so much energy as to arouse him from his abstraction, at the same
	time nodding his head at Rust&#8217;s office, &#8216;<em>his</em> cake being dough, our bargain&#8217;s
	up; and here am I, Edward Kornicker, Esquire, attorney and
	counsellor at law, a man of profound experience, severe knowledge of
	the world, of great capacity in various ways, though of small means&#8212;I
	think I may say of d&#8212;&#8212;d small means&#8212;once more in the market;
	for sale to the highest bidder. Such a valuable commodity is not met
	with every day. If any gentleman,&#8217; continued he, raising his hand and
	looking round at an imaginary audience, &#8216;is extremely desirous of securing
	the eminent talents of one of the most prominent young men of
	the day&#8212;not exactly new,&#8217; added he, running his eye over his rusty
	coat, &#8216;but wonderfully serviceable; no cracks, nor flaws, no pieces
	broken off&#8212;here is an opportunity which will not occur again. This
	is only a scratch on the surface,&#8217; said he, as he thrust his finger into a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page530" title="530">&nbsp;</a>small hole in his coat-sleeve; &#8216;the article itself is warranted to be perfectly
	sound, and of the best quality. How much is bid?&#8212;how much
	for the promising young man aforesaid? How much? One thousand
	dollars? Five hundred? Two fifty?&#8212;one?&#8212;fifty? It wont do,&#8217;
	said he, in a melancholy tone; &#8216;strike him down to me. The gentleman&#8217;s
	bought himself in; there being no demand for the article in this
	market, he thinks of disposing of himself to some respectable widow
	lady with a small family and a large purse. He may alter his mind,
	but that&#8217;s his present intention.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Here Mr. Kornicker concluded his rather extraordinary soliloquy by
	plunging his hands in his pockets, and dropping into a subdued whistle;
	in the course of which his thoughts seemed to have taken altogether a
	different channel; for it was not long before he said, as if in continuance
	of some unuttered train of thought:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Well, old fellow, I promised you to look after your girl, although
	you didn&#8217;t seem much struck with the offer. But I&#8217;ll stick to my promise;
	although, to tell the truth, I don&#8217;t exactly know how to commence.
	But nothing will be done by sitting on this bundle. So I&#8217;ll to my work
	at once.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He rose up hastily, and was descending the stairs when he abruptly
	turned back, went up to his luggage, and after eyeing it for a minute,
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a hazardous business to leave you here. You can&#8217;t be distrained
	on, nor levied on, because you&#8217;re exempt by law. So you are
	safe from landlords and creditors; the law makes you exempt from being
	stolen too; but thieves consider themselves like members of parliament,
	out of the reach of law. There&#8217;s the rub. You might be stolen; and
	I very much regret to say, that the gentleman who should lay violent
	hands on you would walk off with all my goods, chattels, lands, tenements,
	and hereditaments; but I&#8217;ve no where to take you, and as I
	expect to sleep in this entry, you must take your chance. So, good
	bye, old acquaintance, in case you and I should never meet again.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Having in a very grave manner shaken one corner of the counterpane,
	as if it were the hand of an old friend, he gave his head a sudden
	jerk, to settle his hat in the right place, and descended the stairs.</p>

	<p>The task which Kornicker had imposed upon himself was by no means
	easy; but firm in his purpose of fulfilling his promise, he shut his eyes
	to all difficulties, and commenced his pursuit.</p>

	<p>The first place to which he went was the prison, for he hoped that
	the keeper of it might know something about her, or that she might have
	left her address there, in case her father wished to see her when he was
	imprisoned. But he was disappointed. They could tell him nothing,
	except that Rust neither asked for her, nor mentioned her, and had
	always refused to see her. She had never succeeded in gaining admittance
	to him, except on the night of his death, when the jailer, a
	fellow unfit for his office, for he had some human feeling left, unable to
	resist her tears and entreaties, had let her in unannounced, as mentioned
	in the last chapter. She had left the cell abruptly, had hurried off, and
	had never returned. &#8216;God help the poor child!&#8217; exclaimed the man,
	as he told the story. &#8216;Such hearts as hers were made for heaven, not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page531" title="531">&nbsp;</a>for this world. I have a daughter of her age; and even if she had
	robbed a church, I couldn&#8217;t have treated her as that man treated his
	child.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The man looked at Kornicker, as if to observe the effect of his last
	remark; but probably that gentleman viewed the robbing of a church
	in a less heinous light than the jailer, for he made no comment on it,
	but after a pause said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;So that&#8217;s all you know?&#8217;</p>

	<p>The man nodded.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Good morning to you, Sir,&#8217; said Kornicker; and he walked straight
	out of the building, and had crossed several streets before he had made
	up his mind what to do next. This however was soon settled, and he
	buttoned his coat tightly, pulled his hat firmly on his head, drew on a
	pair of shabby gloves, and performed a number of those little acts which
	in ancient times were known under the head of &#8216;girding up the loins,&#8217;
	preparatory to setting out to his next point of destination, which was the
	girl&#8217;s former home, the place where Rust had committed the murder.
	It was many miles off; and the distance which Rust, under the whip
	and spur of fierce passions, had traversed without trace of fatigue,
	drew from his clerk many a sigh, and many an expression of weariness.</p>

	<p>When he got there he found the house deserted. He entered it, for
	there was no one there to hinder it, but the rooms were empty and dismantled.
	The house had been hired by Rust, and no sooner was he in
	the gripe of the law, than creditors innumerable, who like birds of prey
	were biding their time, kept in check by the unbending character of
	their debtor, came flitting in from every quarter; seized and sold the
	furniture, and left the house desolate. A single dark stain upon the
	library floor, where the murdered man had fallen, was all that was left
	to tell a tale of the past. The dust had gathered thickly on the walls,
	as if preparing to commence a slumber of years; and as Kornicker
	went out, the rats raced through the hall, startled at the tread of a
	stranger.</p>

	<p>With a heart as heavy as his limbs, as he thought of the past life of
	the girl who had once tenanted this house, and then fancied what her
	present fate must be, Kornicker set out on his return. &#8216;If it had been
	me,&#8217; said he, pausing to take a last look at the lonely house, &#8216;if it had
	only been Edward Kornicker who was thus cast adrift, to kick his way
	through the world with empty pockets, and without a soul to say to him
	God speed, or &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry for you,&#8217; it would have been right and proper,
	and no one would have any cause to grumble or find fault; but this
	being a girl, with no money, and consequently with no friends, no experience,
	as <em>I</em> have, it&#8217;s a very hard case&#8212;a very hard case, indeed.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Having arrived at this conclusion, Kornicker took off his hat, wiped
	his forehead, snuffed, and set out on his return.</p>

	<p>Day after day for several weeks he prosecuted his inquiries without
	success; and just when he was in despair, chance led him to success.
	In the course of his rambles, he encountered a person who had been at
	Rust&#8217;s trial, and happened to speak about him; for now that the criminal
	was dead and in his grave, when public opinion could be of no service
	to him, many who had hunted him down began to view less harshly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page532" title="532">&nbsp;</a>the crime which had led to his death; and this man was one of the
	number. He said that, although he deserved punishment for his previous
	evil deeds, yet the best and purest act of his life had been that by
	which he had struck down the destroyer of his child.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Poor thing!&#8217; said he, &#8216;she must have led a miserable life since her
	father&#8217;s death. I have met her several times since then in the street,
	but that was several weeks ago; and then she was very feeble, scarcely
	able to walk: perhaps she&#8217;s dead now.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Kornicker waited only long enough to ascertain that she lived in a
	certain out-of-the-way part of the town, which the man designated, and
	thither he directed his steps, and resumed his search; and after several
	days spent in fruitless inquiries, he discovered her.</p>

	<p>The house in which he found her was a small ruinous building, sagged
	and jutting forward, as if struggling to sustain itself against time and
	dilapidation. The windows were broken; the doors and shutters unhung,
	except a solitary one of the latter, which creaked as it flapped to
	and fro in the wind; and this was the home of Rust&#8217;s child.</p>

	<p>Kornicker ascended the ricketty stairs and paused at the door of a
	room, which a slipshod woman had pointed out as that of the &#8216;murderer&#8217;s
	daughter.&#8217; He knocked, but there was no reply; he knocked again,
	but all was silent. Then he opened the door and looked in.</p>

	<p>It was a small dingy room, unfurnished, with the exception of a bed
	on the floor, and a single chair, on which stood a candle whose flaring
	light served only to add to the gloom of the room by revealing its
	wretchedness. The girl was in bed; her hair lying in tangled masses
	about the pillow. Her cheeks were sunken and colorless, and her eyes
	deep-set and glowing, as if all that was left of life was concentrated in
	them.</p>

	<p>Kornicker hesitated for a moment, and then pushed the door open and
	walked in. The girl looked listlessly up, but did not notice him; for
	she turned her head away with a weary, restless motion, and did not
	speak. Kornicker went to the bed, got on his knees beside it, and took
	her hand in his. As he did so he observed that it was very thin and
	shrunken, and that the large veins stood out like cords. It was hot as
	fire. &#8216;You&#8217;re very ill,&#8217; said he, in a low tone. &#8216;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re
	very ill.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m dying of thirst,&#8217; said the girl, pointing to an empty pitcher,
	which stood on the floor. &#8216;Give me water; the want of it is driving
	me mad. No one has been near me to-day. I tried to get it myself,
	but could not stand.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Kornicker waited to hear no more, but seizing the pitcher, darted out
	to a pump, and in a very few minutes came back again with it filled
	to the brim. The girl&#8217;s eye grew even more lustrous than before, as
	she saw it, and she attempted to rise, but was unable.</p>

	<p>&#8216;You must excuse ceremony,&#8217; said Kornicker, as he placed his arm
	under her back and supported her while he held the pitcher to her lips.
	&#8216;Nursing isn&#8217;t in my line.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The girl swallowed the water greedily, and then sank back on the
	pillow exhausted.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Have you a doctor?&#8217; inquired Kornicker, placing the pitcher on the
	floor.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page533" title="533">&nbsp;</a>&#8216;No,&#8217; answered she feebly; &#8216;I have no money: the last went yesterday.
	I&#8217;m deserted by all now.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Not quite,&#8217; exclaimed Kornicker, slapping his hand earnestly on his
	knee, while he experienced a choking sensation about the throat; &#8216;not
	while I&#8217;m left. I&#8217;m sorry I a&#8217;nt a woman, for your sake; but as I
	don&#8217;t happen to be, I hope you&#8217;ll make no objections on that score;
	I&#8217;ll look after you as if you were my own sister.&#8217;</p>

	<p>It was the first word of kindness that the girl had heard for a long
	time, and the tears came in her eyes.</p>

	<p>&#8216;There, there, don&#8217;t cry,&#8217; said Kornicker. &#8216;It bothers me; I don&#8217;t
	know what to do when women cry. But you haven&#8217;t a doctor; that
	will never do. Keep up your heart,&#8217; said he, rising; &#8216;I&#8217;ll return
	presently.&#8217; Saying this, and without waiting for a reply, he left the room.</p>

	<p>Arriving in the street, his first impulse was not only to feel in his
	pockets, but with the utmost care to turn them inside out, and to examine
	them narrowly.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Not a copper&#8212;pockets to let!&#8217; said he, restoring them to their former
	condition, after a long and unsuccessful search. &#8216;But this girl must be
	looked after; that&#8217;s settled. Now then,&#8217; said he, in a very meditative
	mood, &#8216;who&#8217;s able to do it and <em>will</em>?&#8217;</p>

	<p>This seemed a question not easily answered, for he stood for more
	than a minute in profound thought, in endeavoring to solve it; but apparently
	making up his mind, he hurried along the street. The direction
	which he took was toward the upper part of the city, and he was some
	time in reaching his destination, which was no other than Harry
	Harson&#8217;s house. He crossed the court-yard and knocked at the door,
	which was opened by Harson.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I want a word with you,&#8217; said Kornicker, abruptly.</p>

	<p>Harson told him to come in; led the way to his sitting-room, and
	pointing to a chair, told him to be seated.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I haven&#8217;t time,&#8217; said Kornicker, shaking his head. &#8216;Do you
	know me?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve seen you, but I can&#8217;t recollect where.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;<em>Here</em>,&#8217; said Kornicker, &#8216;here, in this room. I breakfasted here.
	I&#8217;m Michael Rust&#8217;s clerk.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Then you can scarcely expect a cordial reception from <em>me</em>,&#8217; said
	Harson, coldly.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t care what sort of a reception you give <em>me</em>,&#8217; replied Kornicker;
	&#8216;you may kick me if it will be any comfort to you, provided you only
	do what I ask. Michael Rust is dead, and his daughter is now dying,
	with scarcely clothes to cover her, or a bed to lie in; without a cent to
	buy her food or medicine; without a soul to say a single word of comfort
	to her. I wouldn&#8217;t have troubled you, old fellow,&#8217; continued he,
	with some warmth, at the same time turning out his pockets, &#8216;if I had
	a cent to give her. The last I had I spent in getting a breakfast this
	morning; and although it&#8217;s the only meal I&#8217;ve eaten to day, damme if
	I would have touched it if I had thought to have found her in such
	circumstances. But since you won&#8217;t help her, you may let it alone; I&#8217;m
	not so hard run but that I can do something for her yet.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Kornicker had worked himself up into such an excitement, owing to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page534" title="534">&nbsp;</a>Harson&#8217;s cold reception of him, that he took it for granted his request
	was to be refused; and having thus vented his feelings he turned on his
	heel to go, when the old man laid his hand on his shoulder.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Nature puts noble hearts in very rough cases,&#8217; said Harson, his eyes
	glistening as he spoke. &#8216;You&#8217;re a good fellow, but rather hasty. I
	didn&#8217;t say I would not assist the poor girl; on the contrary, you shall
	see that I will. She has no doctor?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No nurse?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Harson rang the bell. The house-keeper answered it.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Martha, put on your things,&#8217; said Harson; &#8216;I want you to sit up with
	a sick person to-night. Bring a basket, and lights, and cups, and every
	thing that&#8217;s necessary for one who has nothing. I&#8217;ll return in five
	minutes; you must be ready by that time. Now then, Sir, come along;
	you shall see what I&#8217;ll do next.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He went into the street, and walked rapidly on, turning one or two
	corners, but without going far, and at last knocked at the door of a small
	house.</p>

	<p>&#8216;A very excellent fellow lives here,&#8217; said he to Kornicker; &#8216;he&#8217;s a
	doctor; and if this girl can be saved he&#8217;ll do it. Hark! there he comes.
	I hear his step.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The door was opened by the doctor himself, and a few words sufficed
	to explain matters to him.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll be ready in a minute,&#8217; said he, darting in the room and as suddenly
	returning, struggling his way into the arms of a great-coat. &#8216;Now
	then,&#8217; exclaimed he, buttoning a single button, and dashing into the
	street, &#8216;which way?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Where does she live?&#8217; asked Harson. &#8216;I&#8217;ll go back and bring the
	nurse.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Kornicker told him, and was hurrying off, when Harson touched his
	arm, and leading him a few steps aside, said in a low voice: &#8216;You seem
	somewhat straitened for money, Mr. Kornicker; I wish you would accept
	a loan from me.&#8217; He extended a bank-note to him.</p>

	<p>Kornicker buttoned his pockets up very closely, not omitting a single
	button, and then replied coldly: &#8216;I ask charity for others, not for myself.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Come, come,&#8217; said Harson, kindly, &#8216;you mustn&#8217;t bear malice. I
	did not act well toward you at first; you must forget it; and to show
	that you do so, you must take this loan from me.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t wish to borrow,&#8217; replied Kornicker.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Well, I&#8217;m sorry for it,&#8217; said Harson, taking his hand; &#8216;but you&#8217;re
	not angry?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No no, old fellow; it&#8217;s not an easy matter to keep angry with you;
	you&#8217;re a trump!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Perhaps you&#8217;ll sup with me when we return?&#8217; said the old man,
	earnestly.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll see how the girl is,&#8217; replied Kornicker; &#8216;good bye. We&#8217;re
	losing time.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Saying this, he shook hands with Harson, and joining the doctor, they
	set out at a rapid pace for the girl&#8217;s abode.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page535" title="535">&nbsp;</a>They reached it without interruption, other than a short delay on the
	part of the doctor, who being of a belligerent disposition, was desirous of
	stopping to flog a man who had intentionally jostled him off the sidewalk.
	Kornicker, however, by urging upon him the situation of the
	girl, had induced him to postpone his purpose, not a little to the relief of
	the offender, who in insulting him had only intended to insult an inoffensive
	elderly person, who could not resent the affront.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Can it be possible that any thing human tenants such a den as this?&#8217;
	said the doctor, looking at the half-hung door of the girl&#8217;s abode, and
	listening to the wind as it sighed through broken window-panes and
	along the entry.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Come on, and you&#8217;ll see,&#8217; replied Kornicker; and seizing him by
	the arm, he led him half stumbling up the stairs, and finally paused at
	the girl&#8217;s room.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Look in there, if you want to see comfort,&#8217; said he, with an irony
	that seemed almost savage, from the laugh which accompanied it.
	&#8216;Isn&#8217;t that a sweet death-chamber for one who all her life has had every
	thing that money could buy?&#8217;</p>

	<p>The doctor glanced in the room, then at the fierce, excited face of his
	companion. &#8216;Come, come,&#8217; said he, in a kind tone, taking Kornicker&#8217;s
	hand; &#8216;don&#8217;t give way to these feelings. She&#8217;ll be well taken care of
	now. Harry Harson never does a good action by halves. Come in.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He pushed the door open very gently, and went to the bed. The girl
	seemed sleeping, for she did not move. He took the candle, and held
	it so that the light fell on her face. He then placed his hand gently
	upon her wrist. He kept it there for some moments, then held up the
	light again, and looked at her face; after which he placed it on the
	floor, rose up, and took a long survey of the room.</p>

	<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a wretched place,&#8217; said he, speaking in a whisper. &#8216;She must
	have suffered terribly here.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;This is the way the poor live,&#8217; said Kornicker, in a low, bitter tone;
	&#8216;this is the way <em>she</em> has lived; but we&#8217;ll save her from dying so.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The doctor looked at him, and then turned away and bit his lip:</p>

	<p>&#8216;What are you going to do for her?&#8217; demanded Kornicker, after a
	pause: &#8216;have you medicine with you?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;She requires nothing now,&#8217; said the doctor, in a tone scarcely above
	a whisper. &#8216;She&#8217;s dead!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Kornicker hastily took the light, and bent over her. He remained
	thus for a long time; and when he rose, his eyes were filled with tears.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry I left her,&#8217; said he, in a vain effort to speak in his usual
	tones. &#8216;It was very hard that she should die alone. I acted for the
	best; but d&#8212;n it, I&#8217;m always wrong!&#8217;</p>

	<p>He dashed his fist across his face, walked to the window and looked
	out.</p>

	<p>At that moment the door opened, and Harson entered, his face somewhat
	attempered in its joyous expression; and close behind followed the
	house-keeper with a large basket.</p>

	<p>&#8216;How is she?&#8217; asked he, in a subdued tone.</p>

	<p>Kornicker made no reply, but looked resolutely out of the window, and
	snuffed profusely. It would not have been manly to show that the large
	<a class="pagenum" id="page536" title="536">&nbsp;</a>tears were coursing down his cheeks. Harson threw an inquiring
	glance at the doctor, who answered by a shake of the head: &#8216;She was
	dead when we got here.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Harson went to the bed, and put back the long tresses from her face.
	There was much in that face to sadden the old man&#8217;s heart. Had it
	been that of an old person, of one who had lived out her time, and
	had been gathered in, in due season, he would have thought less of it;
	but it was sad indeed to see one in the first blush of youth, scarcely
	more than a child, stricken down and dying in such a place, and so
	desolate.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Was there no one with her&#8212;not a soul?&#8217; inquired Harson, earnestly,
	as he rose; &#8216;not one human being, to breathe a word of comfort
	in her ear, or to whisper a kind word to cheer her on her long journey?&#8217;</p>

	<p>The doctor shook his head: &#8216;No one.&#8217; Harson&#8217;s lips quivered, but
	he pressed them tightly together, and turning to Kornicker said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Come, my good fellow, you must struggle against your feelings; you
	must not be downcast about it. She&#8217;s better off than if she had
	lived&#8212;much better off.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not in the least downcast,&#8217; replied Kornicker, in a very resolute
	manner; &#8216;I don&#8217;t care a straw about it. She was nothing to me; only
	it&#8217;s a little disagreeable to be living in this world without a soul to care
	for, or a soul that cares for you; and then there was some satisfaction
	in being of use to some one, and in feeling it was your duty to see that
	no one imposed on her, or ill treated her; but no matter; it&#8217;s all over
	now. I suppose it&#8217;s all right; and I feel quite cheerful, I assure you.
	But you&#8217;ll look to her, will you? I can be of no farther use here, and
	I&#8217;d rather go.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I will,&#8217; said Harson.</p>

	<p>&#8216;You won&#8217;t let her be buried as a pauper, I hope?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No, upon my honor she shall not,&#8217; replied Harry.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Very well&#8212;good night.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Harson followed him down the stairs, and again endeavored to force
	a sum of money upon him; but Kornicker was resolute in his refusal,
	nor could he be induced to go home with Harson that evening. He said
	that he was not hungry.</p>

	<p>After several ineffectual efforts, the old man permitted him to depart,
	with the internal resolution of keeping his eye on him, and of giving
	him a helping hand in the world; a resolution which we may as well
	mention that he carried out; so that in a few years Mr. Kornicker became
	a very vivacious gentleman, of independent property, who frequented
	a small ale-house in a retired corner of the city, where he
	snuffed prodigally, and became a perfect oracle, and of much reputed
	knowledge, from the sagacious manner in which he shook his head and
	winked on all subjects.</p>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE.</h4>

	<p>It was a clear, cloudless night without, and the stars twinkled and
	glistened as if the sky were full of bright eyes, looking gladly down
	upon the world, and taking a share in all its gayety and happiness.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page537" title="537">&nbsp;</a>There was no moon, or rather the moon was a reveller, and kept late
	hours, and might be detected sneaking through the sky at about one or
	two in the morning, when she should have been a-bed; and in consequence
	of her neglect of duty the streets were dark, except where here
	and there the shop windows threw out bright streams of light, revealing
	now a wrinkled brow, now a fat, jolly face, and now a pair of bright
	sparkling eyes, glowing cheeks, and lips like a rose-bud, as the throng
	of people flitted past them; for an instant clear, distinct, with face, feature,
	and form plainly visible, and then lost in the darkness. Some
	paused to look in the windows, some to chat; and it might have been
	observed, that those who lingered longest in the light, were young, and
	such whose faces could bear both the test of light and scrutiny. But
	amid that crowd was a single man, who followed the same course as the
	rest; skulking in the dark corners, darting rapidly across the streams
	of light, with his head bent down and his hat slouched, as if he desired
	to avoid notice. When he reached those places which were comparatively
	less thronged, he paused and leaned against the iron railings of
	the houses, and more than once turned and retraced his steps, as if he
	had changed or mistaken his route. He was, as far as could be judged
	from the sudden and uncertain glimpses afforded of his person, tall and
	gaunt, with sunken eyes, long unshorn beard, and a face disfigured by
	a deep gash. He had the appearance of one broken down by ill health
	or suffering, and his panting breath, as he stopped, showed that he was
	taxing his strength by the pace at which he went. Although he paused
	often, and often turned back, yet in the end he resumed his journey, and
	finally reached the upper part of the city. There he struck into a dark
	cross-street. Once free from the crowd, and where few could observe
	him, his smothered feelings broke out; and muttering to himself, grating
	his teeth, blaspheming, now striking his clenched fists as if aiming a
	blow, he darted on. He did not pause until he came to the house of no
	less a person than Harry Harson. He crossed the door-yard hastily,
	as if he feared his resolution might give way; opened the front door,
	for Harry had no enemies, and his door was unbolted, and entered the
	outer room. The door communicating with the inner room was open,
	so that he could see within; and perhaps never was there a greater
	contrast than between the occupants of those two rooms. In one was a
	man eaten up by fierce passions, desperate and hardened, with all that
	is noble in the human soul burnt out as with a hot iron; in the other
	sat an old man whose benevolent features beamed with good will to all
	mankind. There was scarcely a wrinkle in the broad full brow; the
	hair was sprinkled with gray; but what of that? His eye was bright;
	his mouth teemed with good nature; and his heart&#8212;God bless thee,
	old Harry Harson! what need to speak of thy heart?</p>

	<p>The intruder had come in so noiselessly, although his motions were
	rapid and bold, that Harson had not heard him, but sat reading a newspaper,
	and was not a little startled in looking over it to see a man seated
	within a few feet of him, and gazing at him with eyes as wild and
	bright as those of a maniac.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Who are you, in the name of heaven?&#8217; ejaculated he, too surprised
	even to rise, and looking at the stranger as if he still doubted the reality
	of his being in that spot.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page538" title="538">&nbsp;</a>The man laughed, savagely: &#8216;Look at me, my master; look at me
	<em>well</em>; you&#8217;ve seen me afore. Try and recollect it.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Harson&#8217;s embarrassment was not of long duration, and he examined
	the man from head to foot. A vague recollection of having met him
	somewhere, mingled with an indefinable feeling of suspicion and pain,
	crossed Harson&#8217;s mind as he studied the sunken features which were
	submitted unshrinkingly to his scrutiny. He thought, and pondered,
	and wondered; and still the man remained unmoved. He looked
	again; the man changed his position, and the light fell upon him from
	another direction. Harson knew him at once. He started up: &#8216;Murderer,
	I know you!&#8217;</p>

	<p>The man was on his feet at the same moment.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Down to your seat, Sir!&#8217; said he, in a loud, savage tone. &#8216;You&#8217;re
	right; but you cannot take me alive, nor will mortal man. In that
	room,&#8217; said he, in a low tone, and pointing toward the dark stair-case
	which led to the upper part of the house, &#8216;I killed Tim Craig&#8212;the
	only man that ever loved me. He&#8217;s been after me ever since!&#8217; He
	leaned his face toward Harson, and looking stealthily over his shoulder
	said in a whisper: &#8216;He&#8217;s waiting for me at the door. He sat down
	on the stoop when I came in. I don&#8217;t know why I came here, but <em>he</em>
	made me do it, and I must see where I killed him. It wasn&#8217;t me. It
	was Rust; it was Rust. Hark!&#8217; He cast a hasty glance in the room
	behind him. &#8216;I&#8217;m going, Tim, I&#8217;m going,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Quick! quick!
	give me the light!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Seizing the candle, before Harson could prevent him, he rushed out
	of the room, and sprang up the stairs two at a time. Harson followed;
	but before he reached the door of the upper room, with a yell so loud
	and unearthly that it made the old man&#8217;s heart stand still, the murderer
	darted out; his face livid; his hair bristling, his eyes starting with
	horror. With a single bound he cleared the stairs; crossed the antechamber,
	the gate swung heavily to, and he was gone! And this was
	the last that was ever known of Bill Jones. A few months afterward,
	the body of a man was found floating in one of the docks, and was supposed
	to be his; but it was so mutilated and disfigured, that it was impossible
	to ascertain the fact with any certainty, and it was deposited
	in the earth with none to claim it or care for it, and with no mark to
	designate that the soil above it shrouded a heart which had once throbbed
	with all the hopes and fears and passions that were burning in the bosoms
	of those who were carelessly loitering above its resting place.</p>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER THIRTY.</h4>

	<p>Ned Somers had followed Harson&#8217;s advice in not making his visits
	to Rhoneland&#8217;s too frequent. But whatever may have passed between
	him and Kate, and even if they did occasionally meet in the street and
	stop to speak, and sometimes to hold conversations which were neither
	short nor uninteresting to themselves, that is a matter between themselves
	with which we have nothing to do. Certain it is, however, that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page539" title="539">&nbsp;</a>as Ned cooled off in his intimacy with Rhoneland, he appeared to rise
	in the old man&#8217;s estimation; and he grew more cordial when they <em>did</em>
	meet. It may have been that the suspicions implanted by Rust were
	gradually giving way before the frank, honest nature of the young man;
	or it may have been that gratitude for the assistance which Somers had
	lent, (and which Harson was very particular to give its full weight) in
	disentangling him from the toils of Rust; or it may have been the secret
	influence of Harson, who ventured, whenever it could be done, to speak
	a good word for Ned; or it may have been the drooping face of his
	child, which he was wont more than ever to study anxiously, that gradually
	softened his feelings; but there is no doubt that, to Kate&#8217;s surprise,
	he one day told her to get him pen, ink and paper, and to draw
	the table in front of him, as he was going to write a letter. And it
	must be confessed, that Kate&#8217;s color heightened, and her heart beat fast
	when he had finished the letter, directed it to Mr. Edward Somers, and
	then asked if she knew the address of Somers, which of course she
	did; although she hesitated and stammered as if it were a profound
	secret, and the answer the most difficult thing in the world.</p>

	<p>But her surprise was scarcely greater than that of Ned himself, when
	a boy came to him with a letter which ran thus:</p>

	<div class="letter">
	<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">My dear Edward</span>: Come to me as soon as you can; I wish to see
	you on a matter of much importance to both of us.</p>

	<p class="sign centered_line">Yours truly,<br />
	<span class="author">Jacob Rhoneland.&#8217;</span></p>
	</div>

	<p>Ned felt something bouncing about in a very queer manner directly
	under his ribs, as he read this note; but the sensation was not so painful
	as to prevent his obeying it with a speed that was perfectly marvellous;
	for to Rhoneland it seemed that the letter could scarcely have reached
	its destination before Ned was back with it in his hand.</p>

	<p>&#8216;You got my note,&#8217; said he gravely, as Somers entered, his face
	flushed with the rapidity with which he had come.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I have.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t go, Kate,&#8217; said he to his daughter, who with an inkling of
	what was to follow, was stealing away. &#8216;What I have to say relates
	to both of you.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Some time since,&#8217; said he, rising, and standing in front of Ned, &#8216;I
	wronged you, by making charges against you which I am now convinced
	were false. My mind was poisoned by one who has gone to his long
	account, and whose evil deeds may sleep with him. For this,&#8217; said he,
	extending his hand, &#8216;I ask your pardon; much more frankly and freely
	than I did on the day when we met at Mr. Harson&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Ned took the proffered hand; at the same time pouring out a confusion
	of words, the sum and substance of which was intended to be,
	that he had taken no offence; that he knew Jacob was misled by others;
	that he was not only perfectly willing, but very happy, to make up
	the matter, and say no more about it; which no doubt was very true,
	for within six feet of him stood Kate, with her soft eyes fixed on his face,
	and her little mouth dimpled with smiles, as she observed how swimmingly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page540" title="540">&nbsp;</a>matters were going on. And could he be crusty and dogged? or
	could he cherish a grudge against <em>her</em> father? The thing was impossible.
	The extended hand was grasped, and grasped warmly.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Another thing I have to speak of,&#8217; said Rhoneland, relaxing somewhat
	at the cordial tone of Ned&#8217;s feelings. &#8216;It is but a short time since
	I learnt the full extent of my obligations to you, for the part you took in
	unmasking the character of Rust, and in obtaining from him a disavowal
	of charges against me, which, false as they were, were hard indeed
	to bear, and were breaking me down. I have not finished,&#8217; said
	he, raising his hand to prevent the interruption which Somers was endeavoring
	to make; &#8216;let me complete what I have to say, and you may
	speak as much as you like, afterward. I will not thank you, for
	thanks are but words, and too often mean nothing. Is there any thing
	that I can <em>do</em>, to lessen my indebtedness to you?&#8212;or is there any way
	in which I can pay it off altogether?&#8217;</p>

	<p>He stopped, and looked earnestly in Ned&#8217;s face. The red blood
	dashed up to Somers&#8217; very forehead, and he could scarcely breathe for
	the thumping of his heart, as the idea crossed him that now was the
	time to ask for Kate; nor was his agitation at all diminished by casting
	a glance at her, and seeing her cheeks crimson and her eyes downcast,
	as if she anticipated what was going on in his mind. It must be
	confessed, however, that had Rhoneland had no other clue to his wishes
	than that afforded by his words, he would have been very much in the
	dark; for although Ned attempted to speak out boldly, his lips trembled
	very much, and his voice was not as obedient as he could wish; and all
	that was distinctly audible was the girl&#8217;s name.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Why lad, what ails thee?&#8217; asked Rhoneland, unbending, as he observed
	the embarrassment of his guest. &#8216;You used to be as bold as a
	lion. Come here Kate,&#8217; said he to his daughter; &#8216;this young fellow
	has lost his voice; can <em>you</em> tell me what he wants?&#8217;</p>

	<p>It was now Kate&#8217;s turn to grow confused, and the color to deepen on
	her cheek; nor did she utter a word.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Young man,&#8217; continued Rhoneland, in a grave tone, &#8216;I did not send
	for you to trifle with your feelings. You love my daughter, and would
	ask for <em>her</em>, and you fear to do so lest the request should be refused.
	She is yours. Treat her kindly, and keep even a shadow of sorrow
	from falling upon her brow. If you do not, an old man&#8217;s curse will
	rest upon you; and even though I be dead, and mouldering in my grave,
	where my voice cannot reach you, that silent curse will follow you.&#8217;
	He turned abruptly away, and left the room.</p>

	<p>Ned Somers took Kate&#8217;s hand in his; passed his arm about her
	waist, and drew her to him in so singular a manner, that their lips
	could not but meet; and not only once, but at least some half-a-dozen
	times.</p>

	<p>&#8216;So you&#8217;re mine at last, Kate!&#8217; said he, looking into her very eyes,
	whenever they were raised enough for him to do so. &#8216;Did I not tell
	you to cheer up; and that all would be well? Did I not say so; and
	wasn&#8217;t I right? And now, Kate,&#8217; said he, in a less confident tone, &#8216;your
	father, though a most worthy old gentleman, is somewhat whimsical,
	and might change his mind; so when shall <em>it</em> be?&#8217;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page541" title="541">&nbsp;</a>Kate&#8217;s reply was so very low, that it reached no ears except those of
	Ned; but whatever it was, it is certain that on that day month they had
	been married a week, and were deep in preparations for a merry-making
	to be held on that very evening at Rhoneland&#8217;s old house, which
	had been so furbished up and renovated, under the auspices of the
	young couple, that every thing in it seemed to shine again. A party
	at Jacob Rhoneland&#8217;s! It was a thing unheard of, and produced quite
	a sensation in the drowsy part of the town where he lived. Never had
	a household been in such a fluster as his was. What deep consultations
	were held to prevent the old man&#8212;who seemed to have grown
	quite cheerful and light-hearted, and chirruped about the house like
	some gay old old cricket&#8212;from meddling in every thing, and to throw
	dust in his eyes, so as to make him suppose that he was having every
	thing in his own way, when in fact he was having nothing. And then
	what a time it took, and what entreaties, to prevail on him to let the great
	wooden chest, studded with brass nails, which he never took his eye
	from, be removed to an upper-chamber, to make room for their guests.
	But Harry Harson, who was in the thick of all the doings, in and out
	a dozen times in an hour; rubbing his hands and enjoying the bustle,
	giving advice, suggesting this thing and that, and setting every thing
	wrong; managed to get the great chest out of the way, for he dragged it
	up stairs under Rhoneland&#8217;s very nose, and in the teeth of his remonstrances;
	and depositing it in a little out-of-the-way room, very difficult
	of access, by reason of the angles and turns in the entry, and the size
	of the chest, told Rhoneland that if he wanted it below he might take
	it there himself; but that it was better where it was, and much more
	safe and out of the way; in which opinion Rhoneland finally coincided.</p>

	<p>Betimes Kate came down stairs to receive her guests, looking so
	charmingly, and her eyes flashing with such malicious brightness,
	that on meeting her in the entry Ned stopped to kiss her, and tell her
	that she was looking &#8216;gloriously;&#8217; a performance and observation by
	the way, which he had already repeated half-a-dozen times in the course
	of the last hour. By twos and threes the guests began to arrive, and
	went up stairs. There was a great clatter above, where they were
	taking off their things. It took a wonderful time to remove the hats
	and shawls; for although for a long time up they went, none came
	down. There must have been thirty assembled above stairs. At last
	Harry Harson, who was in the room with Ned and Kate, dressed in his
	best black suit, and looking as young and merry as any of them, vowed
	that he would not stand it, and sallied up stairs and sent them down in
	a drove. How bright and cheerful they all were! how the congratulations
	poured in upon Ned and Kate; and hopes for his future happiness,
	and that he might have a large fortune, and a large family to help him
	take care of it.</p>

	<p>A loud scraping and jingling announced that the music was there,
	and put a stop to such flummery as conversation. The young folks
	were going into the business of the evening. The little stunted black
	fiddler with rings in his ears, was mounted on one chair; the big, fat
	fiddler, who fiddled with his eyes shut, was seated on another; and the
	goggle-eyed negro, with a self-satisfied face, who simpered on every
	<a class="pagenum" id="page542" title="542">&nbsp;</a>body, and flourished the tambourine, was placed like an umbrella in the
	corner, to be out of the way.</p>

	<p>The fat fiddler called out for the gentlemen to choose their partners
	for a quadrille. Then came the long premonitory screeching of the
	fiddle-bow across the cat-gut; then the slight, tremulous jingle of the
	tambourine, as if the goggle-eyed negro were dying to begin; then the
	bustling and hustling, and squeezing of the couples, until they had obtained
	their places in the dance. Then the scientific look of the fat fiddler,
	as he opened his eyes and surveyed the whole, to see that all was
	right; then the slight clearing of his throat, as he threw his head on one
	side, bellowed out &#8216;right and left,&#8217; and forthwith plunged into the matter,
	might and main. Away he went, but fast and furious at his heels
	followed the little stunted fiddler; and loud above the din of both, rose
	the rattle of the tambourine. &#8216;Right hand across! forward two; balancez;
	ladies chain; forward four; dos-√†-dos; chassez to the right;
	cross over; all round;&#8217; here, there, every where, and all over&#8212;he was
	up to it all. In vain the dancers fairly flew; the fat fiddler was equal
	to all emergencies; he never lagged; he was sometimes too fast, but
	never&#8212;no, not for a single instant&#8212;was he behind.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Whew!&#8217; said he, as he gave the final flourish of his bow, and laying
	it aside, wiped his forehead on his coat-sleeve, and called for a tumbler
	of cold water. And thereupon the stunted fiddler and the tambourine
	made the same request; the latter suggesting that his glass might
	be tempered with a &#8216;small spirt of gin,&#8217; without hurting his feelings.</p>

	<p>In that dance, the lightest step and merriest voice was that of Harson,
	who led out the bride, and footed it there with the best of them; and
	who through the whole evening was bustling around the room, with a
	kind word for every one, and as much at home as if the house, and the
	company, and even the bride, belonged to him. And in fact, one or two
	of the guests&#8212;but they were unsophisticated people from the country&#8212;were
	for some time under the delusion that Harry was the bridegroom,
	instead of the quiet young fellow who was seen walking about
	the rooms, talking to the disagreeable old women, and getting partners
	for the ugly young ones, without their knowing it; but all in such an
	unobtrusive manner that he seemed quite a nobody when compared with
	Harson.</p>

	<p>But there must be an end even to the merriest meetings; and when
	they had kept it up until the night had got among the small hours, they
	began to drop off. And here, amid the adieus of departing guests, we
	will take our leave of the young couple; for it is far pleasanter to bid
	farewell to those whose friendship we have cherished when hope is strong
	and bright, than when care or disappointment has flung its shadow over
	their hearts.</p>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER THE LAST.</h4>

	<p>A few weeks had elapsed, and a small group were gathered one evening
	at Harson&#8217;s fireside. It was composed of three persons beside
	Harson. The first was a man of about fifty; he might have been
	younger; and the heavy wrinkles which were scored across his forehead
	<a class="pagenum" id="page543" title="543">&nbsp;</a>may have been the fruit of trouble and care, for they were almost
	too deep for his years; his mouth was firmly compressed, like that of
	one in the habit of mastering strong feelings; and the whole character
	of his face would have been stern, but for his dark, gray eye, which at
	times brightened up almost to childish playfulness. This was Mr.
	Colton, the father of Harson&#8217;s proteg√©, Annie. The child herself was
	seated on Harson&#8217;s knee, sound asleep, with her head resting on his
	breast. The only other person in the group was the wife of Mr. Colton.
	She was quite young, and had once possessed great beauty&#8212;the beauty
	of youth and happiness; but that was gone, and in its place was the patient
	look of one who had suffered much, and in silence. She spoke
	seldom, and in a low tone, so soft and musical that one regretted when
	the voice ceased.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Your letter,&#8217; said Mr. Colton, in continuation of a previous conversation,
	&#8216;put an end to all my plans respecting my poor niece. I had
	hoped to assist her; for knowing her father&#8217;s hostility to her, I feared
	that she might be in want. Her death was a very melancholy one.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He looked in the fire in deep thought, and for a short time a silence
	ensued which no one seemed inclined to break.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I never saw her,&#8217; said his wife, after some moments; &#8216;I think <em>you</em>
	did.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Yes, once&#8212;at the trial,&#8217; replied he, uttering the last words with an
	effort, as if the subject were painful. &#8216;She was very beautiful.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Did she resemble her father?&#8217; inquired Mrs. Colton.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Perhaps I can settle that question more easily than any one,&#8217; said
	Harson, rising up, &#8216;by letting you judge for yourself.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He went to a small curtain which hung against the wall, and drawing
	it aside, disclosed a portrait of Rust&#8217;s daughter&#8212;the same which
	Rust had brooded over with such mingled emotions on the night previous
	to the murder. The same childlike, innocent smile, played round
	the small, dimpled mouth; the same calm, thoughtful expression of intellect
	mingled with gentleness, shone out of the eyes. All was as it
	was when father and child last looked upon it&#8212;the criminal and her
	accuser. Every line was unaltered; but where were they? <span class="special_emphasis">Dust</span>!
	They had acted their part on earth; their love, their hate, their fears,
	their remorse, were past. The tide of time was hurrying on, bringing
	life and death, and hopes and fears to others, but sweeping from the
	earth all trace of their footsteps. To them forever, aye even until the
	last trump, time and thought, and care and feeling, had no existence!</p>

	<p>Mrs. Colton&#8217;s eyes filled with tears as she gazed upon the picture.
	&#8216;She deserved a happier fate,&#8217; said she, in a subdued tone, as if she
	feared to disturb the spell which seemed to hang about it.</p>

	<p>&#8216;It was ordained for the best,&#8217; replied Harson, in a grave tone, as he
	regarded the portrait with a kind of solemn interest. Then, after a moment,
	he added: &#8216;That <em>was</em> her, before want and suffering had laid
	their iron finger upon her. When I saw her, she was dead. She was
	very beautiful even then; but in the short time that had elapsed since
	her father&#8217;s imprisonment, the work of years had been performed; she
	seemed much older and thinner, and more care-worn.&#8217;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page544" title="544">&nbsp;</a>&#8216;How did you get this?&#8217; inquired Mr. Colton, pointing to the picture.</p>

	<p>&#8216;A friend of mine, the person who aided the girl in her last moments,
	accidentally learned that it was for sale, and begged me to buy it. He
	was too poor to do it, and I was willing to gratify him; and so the picture
	became mine.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Mr. Colton looked at him for a few moments, as if on the point of
	making some remark, and then walked to the other end of the room and
	took a seat without a word. He was aroused by the child climbing on
	his knee, and putting her arms about his neck.</p>

	<p>&#8216;God protect you, my child!&#8217; said he, laying his hand affectionately
	on her head; &#8216;may you never know the misery which has fallen upon
	that poor girl!&#8217;</p>

	<p>The words were intended to be inaudible, but they reached the ear
	of his wife, who going up to him, and laying her hand on his arm, said
	in a low voice: &#8216;Come, come, George, do not give way to these feelings.
	You must not be gloomy.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He looked at her sadly, and then placing his finger on his heart, said:
	&#8216;Is not what has been going on here, for years, enough to wither to the
	root every feeling of cheerfulness, so that it should never again put forth
	a blossom?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Hush! hush!&#8217; interrupted his wife, in a whisper; &#8216;if you <em>have</em> suffered,
	you have gained at last what you have always prayed for; while
	<em>he</em>, the one who caused it all, has paid the penalty of his misdeeds.
	Remember what his fate was.&#8217; She pointed to the picture: &#8216;Remember
	too, the fate of his only child. George, George! his punishment
	has been terrible, even in <em>this</em> world!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You are right, Mary&#8212;<span class="special_name">God</span> forgive me! I&#8217;ll think of it no more.
	<em>He</em> and I were nursed in the same arms, and watched by the same fond
	mother. From the bottom of my heart I forgive him. It would be sacrilege
	to her memory, for me to harbor an unkind feeling toward even
	a stranger, if she had loved him.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He was silent for a moment, and then addressing Harson, enquired:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Who is this Mr. Kornicker?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;A poor fellow, with little to help him through the world but careless
	habits and a good heart.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;What character does he bear?&#8217; inquired the other.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Such as might be expected from his position,&#8217; replied Harson; &#8216;full
	of flaws, but with a vein of gold running through it. Nature has given
	him fine feelings, and fortune, unluckily, has placed him in a situation
	where such feelings are impediments rather than otherwise. But he is
	a noble fellow for all that.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Where can he be found?&#8217; asked his guest.</p>

	<p>Harson probably anticipated the object of this inquiry, for he said
	with a laugh:</p>

	<p>&#8216;He has been taken care of; he has been placed where the means of
	livelihood and competence are in his grasp, if he will but work for them.
	And what is better yet, he seems disposed to do so, although not much
	can be expected of him at first. I do not think,&#8217; added he, &#8216;that it contributes
	to the happiness of a young man, with a long life before him, to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page545" title="545">&nbsp;</a>be altogether idle. I will do all that I can to help him; but he must
	work. It will be more easy for him as he gets used to the traces.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The stranger acquiesced in this remark, and then added: &#8216;I will take
	his address, nevertheless, for I must see him when I return to the city,
	which will be very shortly; but you seem to have anticipated me in
	every thing. Even the lawyer, Mr. Holmes, declined to be paid for his
	services. He said that <em>this</em> was not strictly a business matter, and that
	what he had done was out of friendship for you, and that I had better
	pocket the fee and drop the subject; at the same time, he said he was
	going to dinner, and asked me to join him, which I did, and a very
	pleasant time we had of it.&#8217;</p>

	<p>A good-natured laugh was indulged at the peculiarities of the old
	lawyer, and many stories told of him, and of others who have figured
	in this history. Nor was it until the little clock over the mantel-piece
	seemed to give a very vehement wag of its pendulum as it struck twelve,
	and Spite, who had been asleep in the corner, bounced up, alarmed at
	the lateness of the night, and barked vociferously, that they dreamed of
	going to bed.</p>

	<p>The strangers were Harson&#8217;s guests that night; and the old man,
	having escorted them to their room, and wished them good night, was
	himself soon in bed and asleep.</p>

	<p>Bright and early the next morning, they were astir; for they were to
	leave the city, and Harson was up and ready to see them off. It was
	a fine morning; the trees were just beginning to put forth their spring
	leaves, and the grass in the public squares was looking quite fresh and
	green, as they drove down to the wharf, where the steamer lay, whizzing
	and puffing, and groaning as if in mortal pain, and tugging at its
	cable like some shackled sea-monster struggling to escape to its home
	in the deep. Early as it was, crowds were hurrying to and fro; carts
	driving up and unloading; porters staggering along with trunks and
	bales on their shoulders; carriages dashing up at a gallop, filled with
	people afraid of being too late, and going off more leisurely after the
	passengers were deposited on the wharf. People were bustling hither
	and thither, elbowing their way to one place, merely to find out where
	to elbow it to the next; friends were bidding each other adieu; and in
	particular, a stout lady from the country, in yellow ribbons, from the
	upper part of the boat was sending a confidential message to her family
	and friends by a gentleman who stood in the crowd some sixty yards off.</p>

	<p>Through this throng the coach containing our friends drove, and just
	in good time, for as they stepped on board, the last bell rang.</p>

	<p>&#8216;All aboard!&#8217; shouted the captain; &#8216;take in the plank.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Harson shook hands with his friends. &#8216;God bless thee, my child!&#8217;
	said he, pressing Annie in his arms. The next moment he stepped
	on shore; and the boat glided from the dock, and shot out upon the
	green water.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ah, Annie!&#8217; said the old man, as he stopped waving his hand, and
	turned away from the river, &#8216;I had hoped that you would have been
	mine own as long as I lived; but it&#8217;s all right as it is. Your brother,&#8217;
	added he, &#8216;I did not miss much, when his parents took him, but <em>you</em>
	had become a part of my home. Well, well!&#8217;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page546" title="546">&nbsp;</a>No doubt there was a great deal of hidden consolation in these last
	words; for Harson&#8217;s face soon recovered its usual cheerful character,
	and he steadily trudged toward his home.</p>

	<p>A few words respecting the other characters, and our task is ended.</p>

	<p>Grosket was induced by Mr. Colton to remove to the country, where
	an intercourse with different and better men than those with whom he
	had hitherto associated tended in a great measure to soften his character,
	and temper his fierce passions&#8212;the offspring of persecution and
	suffering.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Blossom, at first alarmed by the fear of the law, grew penitent
	and rigorous in the discharge of her moral obligations to society; but
	the Law being a notorious sleepy-head, and never appearing to have its
	eyes open, she gradually fell into her old habits, re√∂pened her &#8216;seminary
	for lambs;&#8217; and from the great quantity of her disciples which
	frequent the thoroughfares of the city at present, I should judge is getting
	along prosperously. Mr. Snork was extremely desirous of becoming
	a partner in the concern, and made several overtures to that
	effect, which might have been accepted by the lady, had he not objected
	to being deprived of his eye-sight, and seated at a corner to receive pennies
	from passers-by. It was in vain that the lady represented to him
	that this would be the making of their respective fortunes; that blind
	beggars, particularly if they were remarkably disgusting, as was the
	case with him, had been known to retire with handsome fortunes, and
	that some of them even bought snug little farms in the country, and kept
	a horse and &#8216;shay.&#8217; Mr. Snork however, was obstinate; his proposals
	were accordingly rejected, and he returned disconsolately to his
	abode, which was now lonely, his wife having paid a visit to the penitentiary,
	for the benefit of the country air.</p>

	<p>The widow, Mrs. Chowles, still lives in her quiet, blinking little house,
	as cheerful and contented as ever; as happy as ever to hear Harry&#8217;s
	heavy step, and to see his honest face in his old corner in her parlor;
	and although he is no longer accompanied by Spite, who has grown old
	and rheumatic, so that he is unable to stir from the chimney-corner,
	where he passes his time in crabbed solitude, except when he turns up
	his dim eyes to his old master, as he hears his voice, and feels his caressing
	hand on his head: all else is as it was in that little household; and
	that it may long continue, is our warmest wish.</p>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">CONCLUSION.</h4>

	<p>Mr. Stites&#8217; manuscript was written at different times, and in different
	hands. The little man was evidently troubled with a defective
	memory, (although I would not tell him so for the world,) and has permitted
	many strange mistakes and anachronisms to creep into his tale,
	which inclines me to think that the whole matter is not so authentic as
	he pretends, but has been gleaned in various parcels from the regions of
	romance. But as he is not a little tetchy on the score of his veracity, I
	can only suggest that the tale be regarded by his good natured readers
	rather as a fiction than sober truth.</p>

	<p>From beginning to end, strong disapprobation has been expressed by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page547" title="547">&nbsp;</a>Mr. Snagg, who says that &#8216;that d&#8212;d dog is enough to kill any story,
	and that for his part, he doesn&#8217;t think much of Stites; never did, and
	never will; and that a single hair of Slaughter&#8217;s tail was worth Stites&#8217;
	marrow, fat and kidneys, all done up together.&#8217;</p>

	<p>It is useless to argue with him; and I find the most judicious mode
	of disposing of the matter is to let the question remain unanswered; by
	which means he soon comes round, begins to discover a few merits in
	the manuscript, and finally concludes with a warm panegyric upon Mr.
	<span class="special_name">Stites</span> himself, always however with a reservation as to the dog, whom
	he swears &#8216;he never shall be able to stomach.&#8217;</p>

	<p>In all respects, my quiet old home remains as it was. The same
	mystery hangs about it as formerly. The interest which for a time was
	excited respecting it, when I gave an account of the murder which had
	left it shunned and tenantless, has died away; and with the exception
	of Mr. Snagg, Mr. Stites, and my dog, I have few visiters. Perhaps it
	is best that it should be so; for I have the spectres of no hard feelings
	nor bitter thoughts, nor painful recollections to haunt me, requiring excitement
	and bustle to drive them off; and old age demands time for
	solemn thought and serious meditation, to enable it to wean itself from
	the past, and look cheerfully forward to the future.</p>

	<p>But no more of myself. My task is ended; and I now bid you farewell!</p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page549" title="549">&nbsp;</a>PROFESSOR SHAW.</h2>

	<p class="subtitle">A SKETCH.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Plutarch Shaw</span>, the naturalist, was lately in the stocks, which has
	been a matter of much talk among the virtuosi, and a good deal of malicious
	laughter on all hands. He cut a devil of a figure, rest assured,
	propped up in a straight jacket, his eye fiery with vengeance; the innocent
	victim of &#8216;circumstances,&#8217; and that very common error of putting
	the saddle on the wrong horse. A very little explanation will serve to
	place this matter in the right light, and show by what a fantastic adventure
	an honest man, who was alway given to roam over much territory,
	was suddenly placed upon the limits, and one of the most profound
	explorers of the curious became himself for the time being a
	curiosity.</p>

	<p>Mr. Shaw is so much of an enthusiast, that it is very unpleasant to
	stand near him when he is talking about his bugs, or exhibiting his
	specimens, on account of being spattered all over with the spray of his
	eloquence. A bat shot down in the dusk of the evening is enough to
	set him half crazy, and make the saliva fly all over; it rolls and surges
	against the bulwarks of his jagged teeth in a rabid foam, showers out
	with his descriptions, and makes him only tolerable at arm&#8217;s length.
	The beetles and butterflies which he has transfixed are innumerable;
	and he is perpetually syringing down the humming-birds, as stationary
	on vibrating wings, these beautiful creatures of the air plunge their
	beaks deep into the cups of flowers. With him pin-money is an item.
	If he marks any thing curious in the natural world, he &#8216;sticks a pin
	there,&#8217; and keeps it for future reference; any thing from a lady-bug
	ready to unfold suddenly the gauze upon its hard back, where you would
	think no wings existed, and fly away, to an offensive black beetle that
	snuffs the candle, or cracks its head against the wall, thence upward in
	the scale to the bird which Liberty loves as her sublimest emblem, the
	proudest of the proud, the bird of our own mountains, and the eagle of
	our own skies.</p>

	<p class="quotation">&#8216;I would not heedlessly set foot upon a worm,&#8217;</p>

	<p>writes Cowper: not so however with the great Shaw, whose collection
	of worms is most disgusting; exceeded only by his reptiles preserved
	in spirits, with all their sickening exhibition of claws. He has got some
	dragons that fall little short of the Devil himself in general hideousness
	and outrageous tails; some noots brought from Nootka Sound; some
	green monsters from Green Bay; some devilish things from Van Diemon&#8217;s
	land; and finally, Plutarch is himself hideous, and ought to be
	put in a collection, which by the by, he lately <em>was</em>. It was a great era
	in his life time when he shot a wild-cat; that however has nothing to
	do with the present story, and must be told shortly. He threw a stone
	at him, it seems, to frighten him out of the bushes, where by dint of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page550" title="550">&nbsp;</a>sneaking he discovered something with a white and black fur, moving
	about in a short compass. Breathless with excitement, standing on tip-toe,
	dodging his head among the brambles, all ready, and meaning to
	have a shot at him &#8216;pretty soon,&#8217; he was whispering to himself, telling
	himself in a mysterious voice to &#8216;hold fast,&#8217; not to budge, but wait for
	the next movement; when this <em>pole-cat</em>&#8212;there is a distinction, it is
	well known in the species, nor in the present instance was it a &#8216;distinction
	without a difference&#8217;&#8212;opened the batteries with the precision
	of an artillery officer. &#8216;O my eyes!&#8217; was the exclamation of Professor
	Shaw, &#8216;my eyes! my eyes! my eyes!&#8217; It was a great era in his life
	time also when he shot a plover; <em>that</em> however has little to do with the
	present story, and must be told shortly. It was on the Big Plains, where
	not a tree nor shrub may be seen for miles around; where ambuscades
	are unknown, and it is very hard to steal a march upon the timid birds
	which are frightened at a very shadow; only they do not fear the flocks
	and herds which pasture upon the plains, but tamely pick up the worms
	beneath their feet. Professor Shaw hit upon an expedient to surprise
	them, which no other person would have thought of, than one of his extreme
	ingenuity: a big box, opened at both ends, into which he crawled
	with fowling-piece in hand. First, however, he procured an ox-hide at
	the stall of a neighboring farm, with all its apparatus of horns, and
	placed it over the box, to give it the appearance at a distance, of a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">bon√¢
	fide</em> ox. Sure enough, this scheme worked well. On came the plovers,
	hopping about with much unconcern. Shaw chuckled. He flattered
	himself that he should be the death of some of them, if his own life
	were only spared a few moments. While he hammered the flint of his
	fowling-piece with an old jack-knife, he heard a distant rumbling sound,
	which soon waxed terrible, and caused him to thrust out his head.
	Thunder and Mars! what should he do? If he ran, it was all up with
	him, and he was a dead man if he staid where he was. A wild bull
	of the prairies was cutting up shines at no great distance, tearing up
	the sod with hoofs and horns, and threatening to demolish that refuge
	of lies. Shaw poked out his head, and drew it in again, clutching his
	fowling-piece convulsively, and trembling in an agony of fear. Involuntarily
	he began to say his prayers. &#8216;Our Father who art in heaven,&#8217;
	said he, with great fervor. The bull was now up, bellowing in a tumultuous
	passion, galloping round and round in circles which were diminishing
	with every turn, getting his horns ready to toss the whole fiction
	of an ox, box, hide, horns, Plutarch Shaw and all, into the air. &#8216;Help!
	help!&#8217; shrieked the philosopher; &#8216;I&#8217;ll come out; I must, I must, I <em>must!</em>&#8217;
	And he <em>did</em> come out, by far the most sneaking object for miles around
	on the Big Plains. Some men who were hunting plover from a wagon,
	(which is the right way,) saw his fantastic position with mingled laughter
	and alarm. They drove to his assistance, but the horses shyed off at
	the terrific conduct of the bull, whose onslaught was now made upon
	the box, which he attacked hoof and horn. Mr. Shaw had barely
	strength to reach the shelter of the wagon, into which he was taken,
	much chap-fallen, and resuscitated with brandy-and-water, which were
	luckily at hand.</p>

	<p>He was an &#8216;odd fish,&#8217; unanimously so styled, by those who knew him,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page551" title="551">&nbsp;</a>nor did his appearance belie him, as he started forth on a geological excursion
	in the month of May last, making poems and tuning pianos by
	the way. He strung up the old harpsicords to the satisfaction of the
	country girls, who thought he &#8216;played on music&#8217; with great skill, but
	his eyes were the very wildest. Was Professor Shaw crazy? By no
	means. As a proof of it, he had written several poems as voluminous as
	the Fredoniad; which were unavailing for the present, but which he <em>did</em>
	hope that his &#8216;country would not willingly let die;&#8217; added to this, some
	marches in double quick time, some intricate and inwoven harmonies
	in the transcendental style, stanzas set to music, thrown forth when the
	excitement was upon him, and fugitives from justice. Yet all these
	were nothing, to judge by dark and mysterious hints which were given
	out, of some <span class="small_all_caps">GREAT WORK</span> at which he was now laboring, which the
	world, (he said it with a presentiment of triumph) would be <em>compelled</em>
	to own. But, as I remarked, his appearance did not belie him. Whoever
	might doubt his metaphysics, his legs were unquestionably the very
	longest, by the assistance of which he had lately won a foot-race on the
	Union course for a hundred dollars, to enable him to pursue his studies
	for the ministry. &#8216;Accoutred as he was,&#8217; on one fine day in the month
	of May, he had wandered to a distant part of the country with a walking-stick,
	furnished at the extremity with a small hammer. Absorbed in
	revery, and constructing verses by the way, he arrived at last in a romantic
	valley, where he was soon busily employed in cracking rocks,
	and collecting specimens for his cabinet.</p>

	<p>The solitude and pleasant walks were eminently suited to the mind
	of Professor Shaw. The babbling of the rills which came down the
	hill sides and washed the pebbles at his feet, were soothing to the sense,
	and the birds sang sweetly on the trees, which were covered with the
	blossoms of the spring. Only a single dwelling was seen on one of
	those swelling hills which rose above each other, gently and far away,
	till their last undulating lines were limited by the horizon&#8217;s blue verge.
	The eye wandered with pleasure over the diversified prospect, which
	included the boundaries of three sovereign states, with various rivers,
	valleys and fertile fields. On such a spot, where Nature reigned and
	developed herself in quiet beauty, whether in the voluptuous budding
	of the spring, or in the year&#8217;s gorgeous decline, Charity had taken the
	hint and erected an asylum for the insane. Happy invocation of Nature,
	most kind and gentle saviour of the sick, who meeting her in her quiet
	haunts may touch her beautiful garments and be whole! In the exhilarating
	sunshine, in the fields garnished so exquisitely by our good
	God, in the religious woods, the circling hills, and the unbounded sky,
	there is a force of healing, when Art has consigned the victim to despair,
	and the soothing hand aggravates the deep-rooted sorrow. Nature gently
	re-conducts the lost mind through its labyrinth of error, speaking sweet
	consolation in the passing breeze, and a volume of beauty in each unclasping
	flower.</p>

	<p>Professor Shaw was doubling up his grotesque figure over the stones,
	gathering garnets. With the intent look of a gold digger, or an alchymist
	prying into his crucible, he was seeking for treasures, cracking up
	rocks into the size of sugar-lumps, and Macadamizing all the place for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page552" title="552">&nbsp;</a>yards round. His shadow stalked with him with colossal strides, according
	to the declension of the sun, and the hammer in his shadowy
	arm fell on the projection of the shadowy rocks. But not farther off
	than where his grotesque head and slanting extremity were measured
	on the next wall, two clowns had gee&#8217;d their oxen under a tree, and left
	their basket of potatoes in the furrow, (w&#8212;hoy&#8212;gee, there&#8212;I tell yer
	to gee!) for the sake of giving their undivided attention to the Professor.
	Geology they had never heard of, beyond its application to
	stone fence; so they considered the conduct of a man very queer indeed,
	who was muttering to himself, and filling his pocket full of stones.
	After a little silence, they nodded to each other with a knowing look,
	and said with one consent, &#8216;He&#8217;s as crazy as a coot.&#8217; They approached
	Mr. Shaw, dubiously. &#8216;See his eyes!&#8217; said they; &#8216;aint they wild?
	Mister?&#8217; said the elder clown.</p>

	<p>Shaw made no reply.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Mister, look a-here; aint you&#8212;aint you&#8212;&#8212;?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Fel-spar,&#8217; said Shaw, cabalistically.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Oh dear me! that&#8217;s enough! My dear feller, we&#8217;ve got a duty
	to perform. I guess we know where you come from. Mister, aint
	<span class="keep_together">you&#8212;&#8212;?&#8217;</span></p>

	<p>&#8216;Are you addressing me?&#8217; said Professor Shaw, mildly, looking up.
	&#8216;Are you addressing your remarks to me, my friend?</p>

	<p>&#8216;Wonderful cunnin&#8217;, but it wont do. &#8217;Twont sarve you; I&#8217;m a-feard
	we shall have <span class="keep_together">to&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</span></p>

	<p>&#8216;Well, Sir, my name is Shaw.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s that you got onto your cane? What you doin&#8217; in Queens
	c√´ounty? Do tell, aint you&#8212;&#8212;got loose from somewhar? Honor
	bright!&#8217;</p>

	<p>The professor, lost in amazement, answered only by a broad stare.
	He then bethought him that two lunatics had escaped from yonder mansion.
	The idea satisfied his mind, and surprise gave way at once to a
	smile, full of benevolence and pity. &#8216;My poor friends,&#8217; said he, &#8216;do go
	back; you have surely wandered from home; do go up the hill&#8212;do
	go up the hill.&#8217; Then stamping his foot with an air of authority, he
	exclaimed, stretching out the hammer of his cane, &#8216;Go back to the
	asylum, in-stan-taneously!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I guess the one in the loft will be long enough,&#8217; whispered the rustic;
	&#8216;but fetch the longest of the two <em>ropes</em>, and make haste. Oh, he&#8217;s
	stark!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ah! how sad!&#8217; soliloquized Professor Shaw, as both of his new
	friends retreated, and one hurried out of sight, &#8216;how sad a spectacle!
	the deluded, wandering mind, told by such unerring symptoms; the wild
	eye, strange words, and fantastic pleasantness; reason hurled from her
	own throne, and that steady light exchanged for the fitful flickering over
	decay! They mistake me for one of their melancholy fraternity, poor
	lunatics! whereas my lamp of life, and reason, it appears to me, never
	shone brighter. I shall yet work out something of which my country
	will be proud, and which shall inscribe on an enduring pedestal the
	name of <span class="special_name">Shaw</span>.&#8217; The professor (with his hammer) split a rock. &#8216;If
	those men come back, what had I better do with them? I will contemplate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page553" title="553">&nbsp;</a>the remarkable phenomenon of the mind in ruins. Humanity
	suggests to me that I ought to coax them back with sophistry as far as
	the garden-gate, and then holler for help.&#8217; Shaw was the best hearted
	of men; he would not hurt a human being in the world, cruel as he
	was to bugs, and to centipedes an &#8216;outer barbarian.&#8217; In the course of
	ten minutes he was at the base of a large rock, scooping out garnets,
	and thinking casually of that &#8216;great work which his country would not
	willingly let die,&#8217; when a rope was let over his head and shoulders from
	above, and the professor was noosed. The countrymen jumped down,
	and began to drag him from the other end, squeezing his bowels, and
	winding him round and round, till coming to close quarters, they knocked
	his hat off, wrested his hammer out of his hand, and seizing him by the
	collar, almost throttled him with the knuckles of their immense fists.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. (Kicking violently.) Murder! murder! murder!</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Rustics</span>. It won&#8217;t do no good; we got yer; you may as well come
	fust as last. You&#8217;re crazy as a coot, and wuss now than when we fus
	see you. Your eyes shows it.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. I&#8217;ll go with you, my friends, but don&#8217;t kill me; oh! I beseech
	you don&#8217;t kill me!</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Rustics</span>. No, we wont hurt you; only come along to the house.
	Come along.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. Take your knuckles out of my throat, please. <em>Aside.</em> Their
	hallucination is extreme; the symptoms of their disease have taken a
	form the most vindictive. Yes, my friends, conduct me safe. We shall
	soon reach the house; then all will be explained.</p>

	<p>At this very hour an amusing scene was enacting among the lunatics
	in the large hall of the asylum. One who professed magnetism was
	trying his skill upon a subject, to the great entertainment of his fellows.
	He was making the passes after a singular fashion, upon a docile fellow
	who sat bolt upright in a chair with a face of the most stolid gravity.
	Standing at a distance, he would rush up with long strides, make a wavy
	flourish with his hands over the face of the subject, and retreat as rapidly.
	Then with eager, swelling eyes, aiming with the fore-finger of
	each hand, he would run up and point at some phrenological bump upon
	the cranium. But the patient sat immovable, and was neither to be
	soothed into slumber, nor coaxed into giving any indication that the organs
	were excited; as is the case with the well-drilled <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">proteg√©s</em> of your
	itinerant lecturers.</p>

	<p>Nearly all the inmates were witnesses of this scene, except a few who
	were restricted, and one fair girl who walked in the garden sobbing;
	and never did tears fall out of more beautiful eyes, or shed over such a
	sweet face the interest of sorrow. They gushed profusely on the rosebud
	in her hand; fit emblem of herself; for she had not yet broke into
	the bloom of womanhood. Where tears flow, despair has been already
	softened to sorrow, and smiles may yet shine out of the darkness, as the
	bow of promise bridges only a firmament of cloud. This poor creature,
	frightened at a disturbance at the gate, fled like a fawn to her own apartment.
	The professor was lugged in by the head and ears, with unnecessary
	roughness. Appearances were much against him, as he
	always had a crazy look. His strange dress and equipments, his unshaven
	<a class="pagenum" id="page554" title="554">&nbsp;</a>beard, his long hair straggling over his forehead, his long nose and
	long legs, his much-abused and bunged-up hat, which yawned wide
	open at the crown and showed the lining, wore the external tokens of a
	mind ill at ease. Added to this, a sickly smile shed a yellow glare over
	his features, of which the effect was neither natural nor pleasant; and
	as the lunatics pressed around, and the clowns still clutched him by the
	throat, even that passed away, and left an expression of bewilderment
	and undisguised dismay. At that moment the physician arrived, and
	glancing at the new subject just brought to the establishment, and concluding
	that his present wildness would need some coercion at first, requested
	him to be brought into the nearest apartment. The four formed
	a singular group. &#8216;Sit down,&#8217; said the doctor, nodding calmly to the
	professor, as he prepared to study the case. &#8216;Ha! ha!&#8217; exclaimed Professor
	Shaw, dropping into a chair, and striving hard to be amused at
	his predicament, &#8216;ha! ha! ha! My dear Sir, ha! ha! yes, I think I
	may say ha! ha! ha!&#8217;&#8212;and he laughed so obstreperously as to set the
	whole company in a roar. &#8216;This excursion for scientific purposes;
	near coming to an unpleasant termination; some of your poor fellows,
	doctor,&#8217; casting a knowing look at the clowns, &#8216;are strongly possessed
	they brought me here against my will.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Let me explain all,&#8217; said Mr. Shaw, recovering breath, and speaking
	with preternatural calmness. &#8216;Oblige me first by having those men removed.
	Their presence disturbs me. I pity them from my lowest
	soul; but they have&#8212;it is ridiculous&#8212;ha! ha! ha! yes, it <em>is</em> ridiculous&#8212;but
	they have hurt me very much and disturbed my equanimity.
	You should confine them more strictly, Sir, and not let them go at large
	to murder strangers by the way-side.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

	<p>&#8216;In search of relaxation, during the intervals of a great work which I
	have in hand, having been made an honorary member of the Tinnecum
	Association, I came here for the prosecution of scientific purposes,
	and for the collection of botanical and mineralogical specimens,
	which I have at present in my breeches pocket.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Rustics</span>. He! he! he! that&#8217;s enough&#8212;see his eyes!</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. (<em>Smiling.</em>) Doctor, how long have these subjects been in
	your institution? Their insanity has not taken a very mild form.
	Will you oblige me by removing them from the room? Indeed it hurts
	me to see the immortal mind astray.</p>

	<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. (<em>Enthusiastically.</em>) As I entered these doors, a most lovely
	being shot across my path. It was but an instant; a quick light, a
	momentary flash, and all was gone! But it was enough! I saw her!
	I never shall forget her. Who is she? That sweet girl has impressed
	her image on my soul!</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Doctor</span>. My friend, be calm.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. Oh, my dear Sir! understand me. I <em>am</em> calm, I <em>am</em> calm.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Doctor</span>. Perhaps you will be so kind as to inform me where your
	<em>friends</em> reside, and when you left them upon this journey.</p>

	<p>&#8216;My friends!&#8217; exclaimed the professor, with a bitter sneer; &#8216;who are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page555" title="555">&nbsp;</a>my friends? Where have I found any whose friendship was other than
	a name? My books, my cabinet, my studies, the great work on which
	I am now laboring&#8212;these are my friends; it is only through these
	that I shall be raised to fame. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic itur ad astra.</em>&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Doctor</span>. I am satisfied that we had better secure&#8212;&#8212;</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. Do you want any assistance, Sir? I will willingly help you
	to get these poor fellows to their rooms.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Rustics</span>. He&#8217;s the cunningest we ever seen.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Doctor</span>. Yes, he would deceive any one. Wait a minute my men.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Shaw</span>. If you don&#8217;t need me I&#8217;ll bid you good day; I can&#8217;t stay
	any longer.</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Doctor</span>. Oh no, we can&#8217;t let you go, in common humanity, till we
	have communicated with your friends.</p>

	<p>Professor Shaw, in the utmost alarm, attempted to plunge out of the
	room. He was laid violent hands on by all three; his indignation boiled
	over; he struggled most desperately, knocked down the doctor, and attempted
	to jump out of the window, but in the end was overcome, a
	straight-jacket put on him, the stones were taken out of his pocket, he
	was conducted to a separate apartment, and as the shades of night fell
	around him, he almost doubted himself whether he was in his sound
	mind. His wits seemed to be indeed scattered. In vain he tried to collect
	them, and to realize his present position, which was the most false
	and unfortunate one in which he had ever been placed. He charged
	the Devil with conspiracy. He had already sneered at the suggestion
	of having friends; how should he be the victim and laughter of his enemies!
	He imagined them holding their gaunt sides and shaking with a
	spectre-like malignity. Then he thought of the fair girl whom he had
	seen in the garden shedding tears on roses, and strove to weave a chaplet
	of verse which should be more unfading than flowers. What a
	strange destiny was his! The victim of untoward accidents, persecuted
	by some evil spirit, and leading an aimless, desultory life, which he
	yet feared would lead on to lunacy. What should he do in the present
	instance? Be patient? Yes, he would be calm, forgiving, philosophical
	as ever. Footsteps are approaching; the door of his cell opens;
	perhaps it is already the token of his release. Yes, one of his own
	townsmen enters. Alas! he owed the professor a grudge, and assured
	the doctor that he was cracked, and begged him to hold on to him by all
	means; he would go and inform his friends. &#8216;Ha! ha! ha!&#8217; exclaimed
	Shaw, as the door closed; &#8216;there it is again; in luck as usual;
	ha! ha! ha!&#8212;ha! ha! ha!&#8217;</p>

	<p>As it grew dark, and he lay on his pallet, a crowd of thoughts and imaginations
	pursued him through a long sleep, and when he opened his
	eyes to the morning light, he gazed around the strange place with astonishment,
	and tried in vain to persuade himself that his present position
	was not a dream.</p>

	<p>In three days he was released from limbo; retracing his steps, with
	all the bugs and specimens which he had collected. And, for those who
	feel an interest in Professor Shaw, it may be agreeable to know, that in
	his wanderings, having discovered in a green lane, on the margin of a
	duck-pond, a district school in want of a pedagogue, he forthwith assumed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page556" title="556">&nbsp;</a>the birch, and may be now seen at almost any hour of the day, in
	the midst of his noisy populace, commanding silence, or dusting them on
	their least honorable parts. &#8216;Tough, are you? I&#8217;ll see if I can find a
	tender spot. Come, no bawling, or I&#8217;ll flog you till you stop. Thomas
	Jones, take your book, and stick your nose in the c-o-rner. First division
	may go out. First class in <span class="keep_together">geography&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</span></p>

	<h2 class="title">AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE PRAIRIE HERMIT.</h2>

	<p class="byline">EDITED BY PETER VON GEIST.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">It</span> happened on the twenty-seventh day of July, in the year of our
	Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, that I, <span class="special_name">Peter Von
	Geist</span>, found myself, in the natural course of events, journeying on
	horse-back along the northern bank of the Ohio river, in the state of Illinois.
	The space between me and the house where I designed to stop,
	and the time between then and sun-down, were somewhat disproportionate;
	so I pricked gallantly forward; as gallantly at least as could
	be expected from a tired horse, and a knight whose recreant thoughts
	were intensely fixed on dollars and cents, supper, and other trifling
	affairs. By dint however of much patience in the steed, and much impatience
	in the rider, we got over the ground, and approached a house
	that had been in sight for some distance.</p>

	<p>It was placed on the summit of a steep, conical hill; there was no
	smoke from its chimney, or voices to be heard, or persons to be seen, or
	other signs of life, in its precincts. The grass grew high and green all
	around the hillock, and there was no road, not even a foot-path, visible
	on its side. Nevertheless, I dismounted, left my horse to improve the
	opportunity of snatching a light repast on the abundant herbage, and
	forced my way up to the top of the knoll.</p>

	<p>The building was constructed in the rude fashion of the country; but
	the chinking had fallen out from between the logs; the chimney had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page558" title="558">&nbsp;</a>partly tumbled down; tall weeds sprung up between the stones of the
	door-steps; the door itself was fastened with a huge padlock; the windows
	were nearly all beaten in, and every thing about it gave evidence
	that it had not been inhabited for several years. The summit of the
	hill was smooth and level. A few stumps grew around the edge; and
	the ground seemed to have been, at some former time, a garden.</p>

	<p>The situation was exceedingly fine, and the view on all sides very
	beautiful. The eminence commanded on one hand three or four miles
	of the river, and on the other an unlimited tract of prairie. At the
	particular moment when I first visited it, the level sun-light came glancing
	over the face of flood and field, tinging every thing that it touched
	with its own mellow hue, and casting gigantic and ill-defined shadows
	of the hill, the house, and myself, on the plain beyond. At the distance
	of a mile and a half below, stood a couple of one-story houses, the logs
	of which they were built newly hewed, evidently of recent construction.
	The inhabitants of this old building, then, must have stood where I am
	standing, and gazed over the vast extent of country that is spread out
	before me, without meeting a single habitation of man, or any thing
	having life, except perhaps a wolf or a buffalo. And it could not have
	been desire of wealth that induced a family of refinement and taste,
	such as the little decorations and ornaments show that this was, to select
	this solitude for their home; for not more than an acre of land, at the
	foot of the hill, had ever been invaded by the plough.</p>

	<p>There were several circumstances like these, that were unusual and
	unaccountable; but not being in a mood just then to be much perplexed
	about it, I descended the knoll, remounted, and hurried on towards
	the more hospitable dwellings below.</p>

	<p>Of course, the traveller was received with a welcome, and his bodily
	wants speedily and abundantly cared for. After this most important
	duty had been satisfactorily performed, and quietude of spirit consequent
	thereon was restored to my breast, it chanced that the host and his blue-eyed,
	golden-haired, neatly-dressed, smiling-faced, half-matron, and
	half-girlish young wife, who had lately set up business on their own
	account, and I, seated ourselves without the door, to feel the cool air of
	the evening. It chanced too that the door faced the east; and the old
	house towered up darkly in the distance before us. In answer to my
	inquiries, they were able to give but little information concerning it,
	and that chiefly derived from others.</p>

	<p>It appeared that there was on the other side of the river, and a little
	lower down, a small settlement. It had stood there from time immemorial;
	at least, the memory of the tidy little wife did not run to the contrary,
	and she had received her birth and education there, and ought to
	know. She remembered, one of the first things that she could remember,
	a middle-aged gentleman, in a black hat and coat, who used to row
	over the river from the other shore in a small skiff, and walk into her
	father&#8217;s store to make his purchases, with a grave, but not cold or forbidding
	face, and used to pat her on the head, with such a fatherly smile,
	and say a few words in such a kind tone, as to fill her little breast quite
	full with delight. She remembered more distinctly, a few years later,
	how this same gentleman used to come into the settlement as often as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page559" title="559">&nbsp;</a>once-a-week, and how glad every one appeared to meet him and shake
	hands with him. The villagers seemed to repose unlimited confidence
	in him. The moment he landed, half-a-dozen were ready to ask his
	advice, or to show him papers, to see if all were correctly done. He
	was the umpire in all differences and quarrels, and seldom failed to send
	away the disputants at peace with each other. If there was a wedding,
	he of course must be present. On May-day, when the boys and girls
	went out into the woods to romp, and afterward to sit down to a rustic
	pic-nic, he was sure to walk into their midst, just at the right moment,
	bearing in his hand a wreath of flowers, so beautiful, and so tastefully
	made, that all the girls cried when at length it fell to pieces; and he
	would place it on the head of the Queen of May with such a gentle,
	sweet little speech, that she would blush up to the tips of her ears, and
	all her subjects would clap their hands and laugh out with pleasure.</p>

	<p>At Christmas parties his place was never empty; and while he was
	there, mirth never flagged. Perhaps their sports were not so boisterous
	as they would have been if he had not been a spectator; but they were
	quite as pleasant at the time, and a great deal pleasanter when looked
	back upon from the next day. He used to sit in one corner, by the
	huge, roaring fire, and look on, apparently as much interested as they
	themselves were. Nothing went amiss; and there was never wanting
	some slight, good-natured remark or act, to rectify mistakes and set
	them all going again.</p>

	<p>But much as he was loved by the villagers, he was no less respected.
	They did not even know his name. Many would have been glad to,
	and wearied themselves by indirect methods to find it out. But as no
	one had courage to ask him, and as it never happened to fall from him
	incidentally, they remained in the dark about it. He was known and
	addressed however, by the appellation of &#8216;the Lawyer,&#8217; as their conversation
	with him was chiefly asking his advice on points of law too knotty
	for them, which he freely gave. He affected no mystery or reserve;
	yet there was something in his bearing, affable and unaristocratic as it
	was, that caused those very men&#8212;who, if the governor of the state had
	come among them, would have slapped him on the back, and offered him
	a glass of liquor&#8212;to rise in his presence and approach him with respect.</p>

	<p>My bright-eyed informant, with her musical voice, recollected, a good
	while ago, when she was about ten years old, and he had become gray
	and wrinkled&#8212;though he never needed a staff, nor was his eye
	dim&#8212;that he rowed over one spring afternoon, and requested the men
	to leave their work for a few minutes, and hear something that he had
	to say to them. Accordingly, they collected &#8216;considerable of a little
	crowd&#8217; around her father&#8217;s store. The lawyer stood in the door, while
	she made her way through the throng and sat down on the door-step, at
	his feet. She did not remember all that he said; only that he talked to
	them for about half an hour, in a calm, conversational tone, on the
	importance of building school-houses and educating their children.
	They seemed to be much pleased with what he said; and after another
	half hour&#8217;s free discussion, the whole village turned out, and went to
	work felling trees and hewing timber; and in the course of a few days
	<a class="pagenum" id="page560" title="560">&nbsp;</a>a substantial school-house was erected. From that time forth, she and
	all her brothers and sisters, and all her play-mates, at stated hours and
	seasons, were rigidly imprisoned therein, and diligently instructed in the
	rudiments of science.</p>

	<p>About this time, she and a brother who was about two years older
	embarked on a voyage of discovery. They pulled up the river, at least
	he did, for she only held the rudder, two miles, till they come in sight
	of the residence of the Great Unknown. There stood the old house, as
	she had often gazed at it with wondering eyes from the opposite bank,
	just as grim, and dark, and gloomy. It had been their intention to make
	an open descent upon it, and boldly beat up the premises. But now, the
	building was so silent, and deserted, and frowning, their hearts failed
	them, and they crept cautiously along up the southern shore till they
	were concealed by a bend in the river; then striking across, they floated
	down, by accident as it were, close under the northern bank. When
	they arrived under the hill, on the top of which the object of their curiosity
	was placed, they looked anxiously up at it; but every thing was
	as silent as the grave. Seeing it thus unguarded, they took courage,
	ran the skiff ashore, and prepared to land. But when on the point of
	stepping on the beach, the door of the house opened, the man himself
	walked out therefrom and advanced to the brow of the eminence. There
	he stood; black all over, except his face, which at that instant appeared
	to wear a peculiarly terrible and ferocious aspect. The children were
	frightened, and hastily shoved off their little cockle-boat. But the man
	came down to the edge of the water, and called them by name to return.
	<em>She</em> thought how far off home was, and no one near to afford assistance
	in case of need; and when she thought, she would have been glad to
	have retreated as fast as possible; but her brother was commander of
	the expedition, and without more words he pushed back to land.</p>

	<p>They went ashore, neither of them altogether devoid of fear and
	trembling, and sat down on the grassy bank, by the side of their venerable
	friend. He soon talked away their timidity; and seemed so mild
	and affectionate, that in a few minutes they were chatting and laughing
	as merrily as ever children could. He showed them his garden, his
	trees, and flowers, and fruits. He gave them a little basket, which
	they filled with strawberries, some of which he squeezed between his
	fingers and rubbed on her cheeks, to see he said, if they could be made
	any redder. In fine, he amused them so much with his stories, and
	was so pleasant and kind, that they fell more than ever in love with
	him; and after promising a dozen times to come and see him every
	week while it was summer, they returned gaily home.</p>

	<p>But the old man died at last. The children went up one sunshiny
	morning to pay him a visit, and found the house all still, and the door
	locked. They knocked and knocked, but no one answered. They
	peeped in at the window and saw him stretched at length on the bed,
	fully dressed, with a handkerchief over his face, and his gray hair lying
	dishevelled on the pillow. They called to him; but still there was no
	answer. Then they became alarmed, and hurried home. Some men
	came up, broke open the door, and found him dead. Without sickness,
	or premonition of any kind, he had calmly passed away.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page561" title="561">&nbsp;</a>They dug his grave by the side of the cottage, and laid him in it,
	with his feet to the east and his head to the west; and left him to rest
	there, unknown and unnamed in death, as he had been in life. The
	whole village, men, and women, and children, mourned for him many
	days. But when the days of lamentation were ended, and they saw his
	face no more, though their grief abated, his memory did not, and has not
	yet passed from their hearts.</p>

	<p>I observed the voice of my hostess to falter more than once, while
	telling this simple and dream-like story of her childhood. I could see
	by the night-lights too that her bright eyes sometimes became brighter
	and sometimes dimmer; both of which circumstances made it only the
	more pleasant for me to sit and listen to her words.</p>

	<p>&#8216;There were no letters,&#8217; she said, found in his possession from which
	they could learn his name. There were no writings of any kind, except
	a bundle of old papers, which she had looked into, but they seemed
	to be only disconnected thoughts and memoranda of events and feelings,
	and threw no light on his history. At my request she produced a lamp
	and spread out the papers on the table. I turned over the worn and
	time-stained manuscripts; but the leaves were loose, unnumbered, and
	put together at random, and it was some time before I could find a place
	to begin at.</p>

	<p>At length, however, I managed to bring a few sheets in juxtaposition,
	such, that with a little stretch of the imagination I could discern a
	slight connection between them. And thus, by dim lamp-light, alone,
	with the silence of night around, and the old house lifting up its dark
	and shadowy form in the distance, I read some of the old man&#8217;s papers.</p>

	<p>Those which I read I took the liberty of putting into my portmanteau,
	arguing that though they might be of no use to me, they certainly would
	be of none to their present possessors. Some of these papers having
	appeared in the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, and met with &#8216;acceptance bounteous,&#8217;
	I am induced to transcribe for the edification of the reader, a portion of
	the autobiography of the writer. It is contained in the last chapter, or
	sheet, and is written in a different and more aged hand than the rest;
	and gives the &#8216;moving why&#8217; of the old man, in isolating himself from his
	kind, in one of the great green deserts of the West, &#8216;for which the
	speech of England hath no name.&#8217;</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">A DREAM OF YOUTH.</h3>

	<p><span class="first_word">Sixty</span> years old! Many sorrows, many storms encountered, both
	within and without, and much journeying along the road of life, have
	left their traces on my features and on my head; but I am thankful
	that they have not touched my heart. I live alone, but not solitary;
	for I hold daily communion with the absent and beloved; communion
	also, sad but sweet, with the departed. The forms of those once hated
	too, are ready to rise up at my bidding; but they are never summoned.
	For I wish all within me to be gentleness and repose; and it ill becomes
	me on this my last failing foothold on the verge of the grave, to allow
	thoughts of hatred to stir up the turbid waters of bitterness which have
	been slumbering so many years in my heart.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page562" title="562">&nbsp;</a>So I stand up here calmly at the end of my journey, and look back
	on the path which I have trodden. And what a path! Far back it runs,
	growing fainter and narrower, till I lose sight of it, an indistinct line,
	in the distance. I shall not say how many steep hills it crosses, where
	it might better have kept in the plains; how many deviations it makes
	from a straight course, apparently for the sole purpose of wandering
	through difficult places; or how often it runs along over burning sandy
	deserts, parallel with, and but a few steps from, the verge of a cool and
	pleasant meadow. I shall say nothing of this; for of the million of
	paths that intersect this vast plain of Life, there is probably not one
	which, when the traveller looks back upon it, does not like mine seem
	marked out by the veriest caprice of chance. Each one gropes its way
	along, like the crooked track of a blind man; and when it would appear
	the easier and almost the only way to keep on up the gentle eminence,
	whereon might have been found renown and happiness, by that same
	constant fatality, it suddenly turns short off to one side, plunges down
	into the rocky ravine, and pants on, for many a weary mile. That man
	shapes not his own ends, is a truth which I felt long since, and which
	each day&#8217;s experience brings home to me with the freshness of a new
	discovery. It is a truth which rises up and mocks us, when we sit
	down to calculate or plan for the future; and it almost staggers our
	confidence in the connection between human means and the desired
	result.</p>

	<p>But what a path! Proceeding out of the darkness of morning, it
	struggles through a brief day, sometimes in sunshine, and sometimes in
	shade, and ends in the darkness of night. I glance along it, and the
	care-worn faces of the companions of my manhood rise up, on either
	side, and farther back, the speaking countenances of the friends of
	my youth. It is but a narrow space, the land of Youth, and soon passed;
	but pleasant, and full of images of beauty. The sun is not so bright
	and hot upon it as on some other parts of the path; but we do not expect
	happiness in the garish light of mid-day and reality. The mellowness
	of a summer evening sunset lays on it, and thereby it becomes a
	fa√´ry land, a land of bliss and dreams. How throng up, as I gaze, the
	forms of those early and best-loved friends! How distinct and life-like,
	even at this distance, are their characters and features! They are all
	there; not one name has been erased, and not one picture dimmed, on
	the tablet of memory. The same warm smile of kindling pleasure
	greets me; the same hands are thrown out, as if to touch my own; and
	those bright eyes grow brighter as they are turned toward me.</p>

	<p>It is with such companions that I spend the last days of my earthly
	pilgrimage; and thus, as I said before, though alone I am not solitary.
	Is not such companionship sweet? When they visit me, I throw off old
	age, as a garment. Smiling thoughts come gently over me, and life
	and happiness, as of wont, course like the mad blood of fever through
	my veins. I feel over again those old feelings, repass through those
	same scenes, and my heart beats faster or grows pale in the same places
	and in the same manner as it once did. The old fields and houses and
	roads come up too, clothed at my command, in the snows of winter, or
	in the beauty of summer. Old scenes, but still fresh and young; and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page563" title="563">&nbsp;</a>I am sometimes tempted to believe that the intervening years have been
	the illusion of a dream, and that I am awakening in their midst.</p>

	<p>All this, some will say, is the weakness of age. It seems to me to
	be rather its strength. The future in life is nothing; and what is the
	bare present to any one? The past, then, alone is left me. And if
	by living in it I can keep my affections alive, instead of letting their
	fires, according to the course of nature, or rather of custom, die down
	into cold ashes, I do not call myself weak if I do as much as possible
	forget the present.</p>

	<p>I had, when I was young, many dreams; such as I dare say all have.
	They seem such to me now, only not at all shadowy. On the contrary,
	they become more and more like reality as my distance from them
	increases, while their hues are as well marked and distinct as ever.
	Many and bright; but the brightest of all, the dream of my youth, is
	that which flashes across my recollection, when there comes into my
	heart the thought of my cousin Jane!</p>

	<p>My cousin <span class="special_name">Jane</span>! Her form comes up before me, light and elastic
	and joyous, as though summoned for the first time, and as though it had
	not been my daily visitor for many a long year. Time writes no
	wrinkle on thy snowy brow, my first love! That glad smile knows
	no weariness, and I know no weariness in gazing on it. Those deep
	eyes, full of feeling; those soft words that thrill; I see and hear and
	feel them now, as I saw and heard and felt them first. Wilt thou never
	be tired of looking up to me, with that sweet, timid, confiding, tearful
	glance? Will the rising flush of thy cheek and thy subdued smile, be
	always fresh as now, and as in that hour when first we met? Thou
	hast been my companion, my unmurmuring, ever-present, unchanging
	companion, through many a dark time and stormy scene; and thou and
	the heart in which thou livest will die together.</p>

	<p>We met, my cousin Jane and I, when she was just putting on womanhood;
	had begun to find out the depths of her own heart, to doubt
	whether those depths ever could be filled, and to feel that unless they
	were, life would be but a blank. Not that there were not many willing
	enough to love her and be loved; the beauty of her form and character
	drew around her a crowd of admirers. But among them all, her nice
	perception saw that there was not one, of whom the exterior did not
	form by far the largest part of the man. Her admirers were good,
	honorable men; she respected and esteemed them; but still, gentle and
	timid and humble as she was, without knowing why, she felt that there
	was an impassable gulf between her and them. Their thoughts were
	not like her thoughts. Her social disposition led her much into their
	way, and though she tried to avoid it, she was told more than once, that
	the happiness or misery of her devoted lover depended on her smiles.
	It was a painful situation for one of her retiring and benevolent disposition,
	to be sure; and it is doubtful to which of the two, the lover or the
	mistress, every such rejection caused the keenest pang.</p>

	<p>But this was not the end of it. Malice soon prefixed to her name
	the epithet scornful; and among her school-girl friends there were
	some who always passed by on the other side. Poor girl! She wept
	bitter tears over these sneers and slights, for she had not studied the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page564" title="564">&nbsp;</a>world enough to learn and despise its despicable things. Even then,
	dear girl! too, she tried to love all the world, that is, all her native
	village. And she succeeded, at least far enough to forgive them all,
	and thus to feel her own mind at peace and resigned. But there was a
	tinge of sadness left on her Grecian face after all; for to the young,
	when the out-stretched hand of kindly feeling is coldly put aside, the
	grief is as great as though the repulse were deserved.</p>

	<p>And I&#8212;I hardly know what I was, when I first saw my cousin. I
	was without father or mother; the world seemed wide and rather
	cheerless; and there was a settled impression on my mind, that it was
	my business to glide along through life, calmly and noiselessly; attach
	my affections to no external object; exist without being the cause of
	joy, and die without being the cause of tears, to any human being. I
	came and took up my abode in the pleasant village where my uncle
	resided, and set down to gain some knowledge of that noble science,
	civil law. I took up the study, not because I had any intention of engaging
	in the active duties of the profession, but for the name&#8217;s sake,
	and because I loved it for itself. My uncle, he was a kind, good man,
	showed himself a father to me, took me into his family, tried to encourage
	and rouse me; and for his kindness, though it failed of its end, he
	had at the time, and has always had, my sincere though unexpressed
	thanks.</p>

	<p>I had hardly become acquainted with my relatives, uncle, aunt, and
	their three children, when I entered my office, shut the door, and immersed
	myself in books and my own thoughts. That those thoughts
	were not of the most joyous nature, I need hardly say. Still, looking
	back to that period, from where I stand now, I cannot say they were
	misanthropic. If I did not love all my species, it was because I saw
	nothing lovely in any body; but I did not hate them. I felt that I was
	an insignificant, an unnoticeable drop in the great world; that it was
	my misfortune to be so constituted as to be incapable of uniting closely
	and mingling with other drops; and that, without offending my neighbors,
	it would be my duty and pleasure to keep myself distinct from the
	rest, and hidden in some obscure corner. In one word, the prevailing
	feeling was, that nobody cared for me, and I cared for nobody.</p>

	<p>And yet, strange as it may appear, I was far from being unhappy.
	Sometimes, it is true, my in-turned thoughts became weary, and pined
	for human fellowship; and I grew sick at heart, as I contemplated the
	future, a vast, dry, waste, desolate desert of parched sand, over which
	I must toil and thirst, without one single being to speak a word of kindness,
	or give me a drop of water. But these were fits, fits of wildness,
	I called them, and seldom lasted long. And when they came over me,
	one attempt to link my sympathies with others was always sufficient
	to throw me back into a state of mind harder and colder than before.
	For it was so fated, that all my overtures, and they were not many,
	were met with open repulse or wary suspicion. It is true, suspicion is
	a necessary ingredient in human character; but I did not think of this
	then, and so it had the same effect as though I had found, indeed I
	thought I <em>had</em> found, that coldness and insensibility were the prominent
	characteristics of the race.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page565" title="565">&nbsp;</a>And yet, as I said before, I was not unhappy. If there was no happiness,
	there was at least no unhappiness, in sitting down for hours, and
	brooding over my own idiosyncrasies. It made me proud, to see and
	despise the weakness of others; and it gave me stern joy, to walk about
	and feel that there was a kind of armed neutrality between them and
	me. By degrees there arose, also, a gloomy pleasure in dwelling on,
	and picturing in deeper colors, the failings and baseness of my neighbors.
	Humble and weak as I knew myself to be, I exulted in my
	strength, because there were some still more weak and humble. Far
	back as my recollection ran, there had never been any thing in the
	world that seemed to me worthy of very much exertion or toil to obtain;
	but now I first learned to despise others for possessing feeble energies,
	as well as for directing them to the attainment of little objects. I am
	afraid, if left to myself, I should have hardened into a genuine hater;
	but I was not left to myself.</p>

	<p>I have mentioned my uncle&#8217;s kindness; his whole family were not
	less kind. My cousin Jane, especially, saw that I was silent, and fancied
	that I was unhappy, and tried, by a thousand little devices and arts,
	to lull me into forgetfulness of myself, and entice me into a more
	sociable frame of mind. I will not say that I was insensible to her
	enticements; I rather liked her, she was so gentle and mild and considerate.
	There was an air of truth and simplicity about her; she
	would sit herself down so cheerfully to amuse me, and there was such
	a sparkle in her blue eyes when, as she said, I condescended to interest
	myself in her little affairs, that I began, at length, to love to be with
	her. But proud as I was, when I viewed mankind at a distance, I no
	sooner came in contact with any one, who was not immeasurably beneath
	me, than I felt myself sinking immeasurably beneath him; and
	so, like a fool as I was, I fancied that all my cousin&#8217;s kindness was the
	result of her sense of duty to her relation; or, what was worse, of pity
	for his moroseness. This faint suspicion became, in a little while, a
	strong certainty; and I confined myself more closely to my books, and
	looked into my cousin&#8217;s guileless, enthusiastic face, with coldness.</p>

	<p>I had known her now a year, and yet I hardly knew her at all; for
	I had seen her scarcely ever, except when it was impossible to avoid it,
	and those occasions were not frequent or long enough to enable me to
	learn perfectly her mind and character. From every such meeting, I
	went away resolved to see her no more in future; which resolution was
	sure to be overruled by second and more bitter thoughts. How I lived
	during that year, I scarcely know; or how it was that I grew uneasy
	away from her, and frequently surprised myself courting her society.
	But as time rolled on, so it was. There was a fascination about her,
	the magic of which was, that it charmed to sleep my vigilant suspicion.
	I did not perceive any change in myself, when night after night I was
	with her, talking to her about poetry, beauty, love, and the thousand
	themes that interest the unrestrained youthful heart; or that I was different
	from what I used to be, when I listened to her, with a gush of
	pleasure, as she spoke at once with lips and eyes, and in speaking, disclosed
	the unimagined riches of her mind and heart. So gradual was
	the change, that I was wholly unaware of it.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page566" title="566">&nbsp;</a>But of one thing I was aware; the face of nature and of man underwent
	a strange and sudden change in appearance. I looked into the
	face of my neighbor, and lo, he was my brother! The fire of benevolence
	and sympathy warmed every vein, and a new life animated every
	nerve within me. I felt no longer that I was alone, but that indissoluble
	cords bound me to the whole human family, to every being in whose
	nostrils was the breath of life; and that for his good, as well as for my
	own, it was my business to labor. New motives of action, (or rather
	motives of action, for there were none before,) were set before me; and
	I felt light of heart and wing; eager to bound forward and lend the
	strength of my arm to the cause of the race. The face of nature too
	was altered. Every part that came within the range of my vision, her
	seasons, her vestments in winter and summer, her sunshine and clouds,
	each one was a melody, and all together made harmony. Still, I was
	scarcely sensible that I was different from what I was a year ago; for
	at each period I felt that I was in my natural and proper state of mind.
	So slight are the influences necessary to turn the young heart into the
	permanent channel of selfishness, hatred and unhappiness, or into that
	of love and peace!</p>

	<p>It was not long before I found out that I loved my cousin Jane. How
	I first discovered it I do not remember; but I do remember a firm and
	abiding resolution, even then, that I would not love her. I sat down by
	her side, I listened to her music, with that distinct impression. I would
	not for the world have had any body suspect my feelings, because I was
	ashamed of the weakness. I had persuaded myself, and could not convince
	myself to the contrary, that there was no hope of her returning
	my passion. And yet, with the words on my lips, &#8216;This is folly&#8212;I will
	not!&#8217; I yielded myself to the delicious current, forgot all the world and
	myself, and in the intoxication of the hour, saw visions and dreamed
	dreams.</p>

	<p>But there came a shock; one which awoke me from a trance like
	that of the Opium-eater. It was when I saw that my cousin&#8217;s smiles
	and attentions were not all devoted to me. There was another, a young
	man of promise and expectations, a year or two my senior, and far
	beyond me in the graces and polish of society, who had lately become
	intimate in my uncle&#8217;s family. Engaged in the same pursuits, and
	being much with him, I had rather liked him; in fact I liked him very
	much. He had seen, admired, and in less than six months, <em>loved</em> my
	Cousin Jane: this I knew, for jealousy is keen-eyed. You will not
	wonder then that I hated him; not on his own account&#8212;alter his feelings
	toward her, and I should have felt toward him as before; but on
	account of his love&#8212;hated him with a deadly hatred.</p>

	<p>It would be useless to tell how often I have sat down and watched
	them, when my cousin&#8217;s sensitive countenance would brighten at his
	bright thoughts, or burst forth into a merry laugh at his brilliant wit
	and ready repartee; or how often the iron has entered into my soul when
	I have seen her hang on his arm, and listen in breathless attention to
	his lightest word, and testify in a thousand ways her pleasure at his
	coming, and in his presence. And <em>he</em>, he looked on me with the most
	immovable indifference. He did not seem to consider me worthy of his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page567" title="567">&nbsp;</a>attention; even as a rival. He went straight forward, calmly and quietly,
	as though I had not existed; and if he ever glanced at my pretensions,
	it was perhaps with a smile of confident success. I knew he
	loved her; I fancied that she loved him, and I hated them both for it.</p>

	<p>I went into my office one day&#8212;if it were not part of the dream I
	would not tell it&#8212;in a state of partial insanity. I knew, saw, heard,
	felt nothing but one unalterable purpose of revenge. There happened
	to be a small pistol lying in the back room; I took it up, and carefully
	loaded it; loaded it without the tremor of a single muscle, for my heart
	was lead. I put it into my pocket, and walked the streets up and down,
	an hour or two, or it may have been four hours. I did not take count
	of the time. The heavens reeled above me, and the earth reeled beneath.
	At last he came. A thrill, the first that day, a thrill of triumph ran
	through my whole frame. When we met I stopped and took hold of
	the pistol in my pocket, but had not power to draw my hand out again;
	the strings of volition seemed broken. He stopped also; looked at me
	in some surprise; made a remark that I &#8216;did not appear to be well,&#8217; and
	passed on. I looked after him, sick at heart with revenge deferred, and
	cursed my own pusillanimity.</p>

	<p>Well, well, we will let that pass. I had yielded my soul to the Author
	of Hatred for a time; but we will let it pass, and strive to forget
	it; I have been trying to ever since; I hope I shall succeed better in
	future. It is pleasant if we can think that the results of our evil passions
	do not extend beyond ourselves; and to me, it is pleasant to think
	that I did not break my gentle cousin&#8217;s heart, by letting her know that
	she had nearly driven me mad.</p>

	<p>It was a month after this. How the intervening time had been
	spent, in what thoughts, and hopes, and fears, it would not be profitable
	to tell, or to recollect. I was sitting one evening by my cousin&#8217;s
	side; it was growing late, and we were alone. I had been heated, as
	though with wine, and had probably talked incoherently. The conversation
	turned on that never-failing theme, love. She delighted to hear me
	speak on that subject; she said I spoke eloquently. If eloquence consists
	in earnestness, no doubt I did. It began in sportiveness, but before
	long became deeply serious and interesting.</p>

	<p>&#8216;And you do not believe, my grave cousin,&#8217; said she, in her own half-jesting,
	wholly earnest way, &#8216;that a woman can love as deeply and long
	as the man who loves her?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Bah!&#8217; said I, bitterly, &#8216;women sometimes, like men, are revengeful,
	proud, or ambitious, but it is on a smaller scale. Every thing about
	them, every feeling and impulse is on a small scale. Very good objects
	they make for men to love; because, when one <em>will</em> be such a fool, it
	doesn&#8217;t much matter where he places his affection.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The poor girl looked grieved, but responded with a semblance of
	gaiety nevertheless: &#8216;Ah, you think so now, but you will be just such a
	fool yourself, one of these days; and then you will find out that it is
	necessary for a woman to have a soul; and more than that&#8212;that she
	has one.&#8217;               </p>

	<p>&#8216;Much obliged for your flattering opinion,&#8217; said I. &#8216;But see here,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page568" title="568">&nbsp;</a>my bonny Jane, did it never enter into your innocent little heart to
	think how <em>you</em> would love?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; she answered quickly; &#8216;but that is all guess-work. I
	don&#8217;t know, because I haven&#8217;t yet found a man to my taste.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Of course I knew that I could not be to her taste; but a plain man
	does not like to be told that he is ugly, though he may be perfectly
	conscious of the fact. And so this avowal, which was made with the
	most unthinking honesty and simplicity, while it added weight to my
	despair, by a very usual consequence, made me desperate.</p>

	<p>&#8216;You are certain,&#8217; I asked, after a pause, &#8216;that you do not know what
	love is by experience?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Perfectly,&#8217; she answered, half laughing.</p>

	<p>&#8216;And that you mean to know, some time?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;To be sure,&#8217; said she, &#8216;when the right man and the right time come.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I do not know,&#8217; said I, beginning slowly and calmly; but before the
	sentence was half completed, my voice and thoughts had escaped from
	under my control; &#8216;I do not know who the right man for you may be,
	but I&#8212;<em>I</em> love you&#8212;love you&#8212;love you!&#8217;</p>

	<p>She looked at me for a few seconds, with a countenance filled with
	astonishment, not unmingled with alarm. She would have thought it a
	jest; but my manner probably convinced her that I was far from
	jesting. She tried to smile, but it was a painful effort, and she found
	it much easier to conceal her face in her hands and weep.</p>

	<p>My recollection of the subsequent events of that evening is extremely
	dim. There was a confused crowd of flying thoughts; many tears and
	much friendship on one side, and much love on the other. She had
	received me as I knew she would, and though by the confession there
	was a great weight removed from my breast, the anguish was not less
	intense. One thing, however, among the hurried occurrences of that
	hour, I did not lose sight of, and that was pride. She did not suspect
	at the time how much of my heart, not to say existence, was bound up
	in her, or how greatly both were affected by her answer.</p>

	<p>The closing scene of the interview is the one which I most love to
	remember. We were standing at the door, her hand in mine, a mournful
	smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye. That bright, gentle face
	was pale with sorrow, and pity, and pain, and above all with fear. I
	gazed on it a moment, but in that moment the picture was graven
	indelibly on my memory. The &#8216;good night&#8217; was spoken; and that is
	the last time I ever saw my cousin Jane.</p>

	<p>The next morning I sat down at an inn by the way-side, several miles
	distant from home, and sent back a few lines of farewell:</p>

	<p>&#8216;My only beloved! You must pardon me for this note. The adieu
	of last evening was only for the night; I wish to say good bye this
	morning, for a longer time. Your answer to my suit was not unexpected;
	in fact, I knew it would be as it was; and it was only a fatality,
	a blind impulse, that drove me to make that disclosure. I fear that it
	has given you pain, and I beg you to forgive my thoughtlessness. And
	in turn, you may rest assured that I forgive you for all the anguish and
	sickness of spirit that I have suffered on your account. There is nothing
	to be forgiven; I know that you would not cause unhappiness to
	any one, and it has been my own folly and madness. But I promise
	<a class="pagenum" id="page569" title="569">&nbsp;</a>not to lay it up in my heart against you. I promise that in future years,
	wherever my lot may be cast, you shall be in my memory, only my
	pure, sweet, innocent cousin. And so, blessings be on your head! I
	go forth a vagabond and a wanderer on the face of the earth. It is
	probable that you will never hear from me again; and I pray you to
	forget our last interview, that your thoughts may be only peace. I
	would live in your remembrance as I was when we first met. And do
	not think, because long years of silence and wide lands and many mountains
	divide us, that your cousin has forgotten you. Your image lives
	in his heart and can never die!&#8217;</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">FROM A LEGEND OF THE SUBJUGATION OF SPAIN.</h3>

	<p class="byline">BY THE AUTHOR OF THE SKETCH-BOOK.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">While</span> the veteran Taric was making his wide circuit through the
	land, an expedition under Magued the renegado proceeded against the
	city of Cordova. The inhabitants of that ancient place had beheld the
	great army of Don Roderick spreading like an inundation over the
	plain of the Guadalquiver, and had felt confident that it must sweep the
	infidel invaders from the land. What then was their dismay, when
	scattered fugitives, wild with horror and affright, brought them tidings
	of the entire overthrow of that mighty host, and the disappearance of
	the king? In the midst of their consternation, the Gothic noble, Pelistes,
	arrived at their gates, haggard with fatigue of body and anguish of
	mind, and leading a remnant of his devoted cavaliers, who had survived
	the dreadful battle of the Guadalete. The people of Cordova knew the
	valiant and steadfast spirit of Pelistes, and rallied round him as a last
	hope. &#8216;Roderick is fallen,&#8217; cried they, &#8216;and we have neither king nor
	captain: be unto us as a sovereign; take command of our city, and
	protect us in this hour of peril!&#8217;</p>

	<p>The heart of Pelistes was free from ambition, and was too much
	broken by grief to be flattered by the offer of command; but he felt
	above everything for the woes of his country, and was ready to assume
	any desperate service in her cause. &#8216;Your city,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is surrounded
	by walls and towers, and may yet check the progress of the
	foe. Promise to stand by me to the last, and I will undertake your defence.&#8217;
	The inhabitants all promised implicit obedience and devoted
	zeal: for what will not the inhabitants of a wealthy city promise and
	profess in a moment of alarm? The instant, however, that they heard
	of the approach of the Moslem troops, the wealthier citizens packed up
	their effects and fled to the mountains, or to the distant city of Toledo.
	Even the monks collected the riches of their convents and churches,
	and fled. Pelistes, though he saw himself thus deserted by those who
	had the greatest interest in the safety of the city, yet determined not to
	abandon its defence. He had still his faithful though scanty band of
	cavaliers, and a number of fugitives of the army; in all amounting to
	about four hundred men. He stationed guards, therefore, at the gates
	and in the towers, and made every preparation for a desperate resistance.</p>

	<p>In the mean time, the army of Moslems and apostate Christians advanced,
	under the command of the Greek renegado, Magued, and guided
	by the traitor Julian. While they were yet at some distance from the
	city, their scouts brought to them a shepherd, whom they had surprised
	on the banks of the Guadalquiver. The trembling hind was an inhabitant
	<a class="pagenum" id="page573" title="573">&nbsp;</a>of Cordova, and revealed to them the state of the place, and the
	weakness of its garrison.</p>

	<p>&#8216;And the walls and gates,&#8217; said Magued, &#8216;are they strong and well
	guarded?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;The walls are high, and of wondrous strength,&#8217; replied the shepherd;
	&#8216;and soldiers hold watch at the gates by day and night. But there is
	one place where the city may be secretly entered. In a part of the
	wall, not far from the bridge, the battlements are broken, and there is a
	breach at some height from the ground. Hard by stands a fig tree, by
	the aid of which the wall may easily be scaled.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Having received this information, Magued halted with his army, and
	sent forward several renegado Christians, partizans of Count Julian,
	who entered Cordova as if flying before the enemy. On a dark and
	tempestuous night, the Moslems approached to the end of the bridge
	which crosses the Guadalquiver, and remained in ambush. Magued
	took a small party of chosen men, and, guided by the shepherd, forded
	the stream, and groped silently along the wall to the place where stood
	the fig tree. The traitors, who had fraudulently entered the city, were
	ready on the wall to render assistance. Magued ordered his followers
	to make use of the long folds of their turbans instead of cords, and succeeded
	without difficulty in clambering into the breach.</p>

	<p>Drawing their scimitars, they now hastened to the gate which opened
	toward the bridge; the guards, suspecting no assault from within, were
	taken by surprise, and easily overpowered; the gate was thrown open,
	and the army that had remained in ambush rushed over the bridge, and
	entered without opposition.</p>

	<p>The alarm had by this time spread throughout the city; but already
	a torrent of armed men was pouring through the streets. Pelistes
	sallied forth with his cavaliers and such of the soldiery as he could collect,
	and endeavored to repel the foe; but every effort was in vain.
	The Christians were slowly driven from street to street, and square to
	square, disputing every inch of ground; until, finding another body of
	the enemy approaching to attack them in the rear, they took refuge in
	a convent, and succeeded in throwing to and barring the ponderous doors.
	The Moors attempted to force the gates, but were assailed with such
	showers of missiles from the windows and battlements that they were
	obliged to retire. Pelistes examined the convent, and found it admirably
	calculated for defence. It was of great extent, with spacious courts
	and cloisters. The gates were massive, and secured with bolts and
	bars; the walls were of great thickness; the windows high and grated;
	there was a great tank or cistern of water, and the friars, who had fled
	from the city, had left behind a good supply of provisions. Here, then,
	Pelistes proposed to make a stand, and to endeavor to hold out until
	succor should arrive from some other city. His proposition was received
	with shouts by his loyal cavaliers; not one of whom but was ready to
	lay down his life in the service of his commander.</p>

	<p>For three long and anxious months did the good knight Pelistes and
	his cavaliers defend their sacred asylum against the repeated assaults
	of the infidels. The standard of the true faith was constantly displayed
	from the loftiest tower, and a fire blazed there throughout the night, as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page574" title="574">&nbsp;</a>signals of distress to the surrounding country. The watchman from
	his turret kept a wary look out over the land, hoping in every cloud of
	dust to descry the glittering helms of Christian warriors. The country,
	however, was forlorn and abandoned, or if perchance a human being
	was perceived, it was some Arab horseman, careering the plain of the
	Guadalquiver as fearlessly as if it were his native desert.</p>

	<p>By degrees the provisions of the convent were consumed, and the
	cavaliers had to slay their horses, one by one, for food. They suffered
	the wasting miseries of famine without a murmur, and always met their
	commander with a smile. Pelistes, however, read their sufferings in
	their wan and emaciated countenances, and felt more for them than for
	himself. He was grieved at heart that such loyalty and valor should
	only lead to slavery or death, and resolved to make one desperate
	attempt for their deliverance. Assembling them one day in the court
	of the convent, he disclosed to them his purpose.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Comrades and brothers in arms,&#8217; said he, &#8216;it is needless to conceal
	danger from brave men. Our case is desperate: our countrymen
	either know not or heed not our situation, or have not the means to help
	us. There is but one chance of escape; it is full of peril, and, as your
	leader, I claim the right to brave it. To-morrow at break of day I will
	sally forth and make for the city gates at the moment of their being
	opened; no one will suspect a solitary horseman; I shall be taken for
	one of those recreant Christians who have basely mingled with the
	enemy. If I succeed in getting out of the city, I will hasten to Toledo
	for assistance. In all events I shall be back in less than twenty days.
	Keep a vigilant look out toward the nearest mountain. If you behold
	five lights blazing upon its summit, be assured I am at hand with succor,
	and prepare yourselves to sally forth upon the city as I attack the gates.
	Should I fail in obtaining aid, I will return to die with you.&#8217;</p>

	<p>When he had finished, his warriors would fain have severally undertaken
	the enterprise, and they remonstrated against his exposing himself
	to such peril; but he was not to be shaken from his purpose. On the
	following morning, ere the break of day, his horse was led forth, caparisoned,
	into the court of the convent, and Pelistes appeared in complete
	armor. Assembling his cavaliers in tie chapel, he prayed with them
	for some time before the altar of the holy Virgin. Then rising, and
	standing in the midst of them, &#8216;God knows, my companions,&#8217; said he,
	&#8216;whether we have any longer a country; if not, better were we in our
	graves. Loyal and true have ye been to me, and loyal have ye been
	to my son, even to the hour of his death; and grieved am I that I have
	no other means of proving my love for you, than by adventuring my
	worthless life for your deliverance. All I ask of you before I go, is a
	solemn promise to defend yourselves to the last like brave men and
	Christian cavaliers, and never to renounce your faith, or throw yourselves
	on the mercy of the renegado Magued, or the traitor Julian.&#8217;
	They all pledged their words, and took a solemn oath to the same effect
	before the altar.</p>

	<p>Pelistes then embraced them one by one, and gave them his benediction,
	and as he did so his heart yearned over them, for he felt towards
	them, not merely as a companion in arms and as a commander, but as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page575" title="575">&nbsp;</a>a father; and he took leave of them as if he had been going to his
	death. The warriors, on their part, crowded round him in silence,
	kissing his hands and the hem of his surcoat, and many of the sternest
	shed tears.</p>

	<p>The gray of the dawning had just streaked the east, when Pelistes
	took lance in hand, hung his shield about his neck, and, mounting
	his steed, issued quietly forth from a postern of the convent. He
	paced slowly through the vacant streets, and the tramp of his steed
	echoed afar in that silent hour; but no one suspected a warrior, moving
	thus singly and tranquilly in an armed city, to be an enemy. He arrived
	at the gate just at the hour of opening; a foraging party was entering
	with cattle and with beasts of burthen, and he passed unheeded
	through the throng. As soon as he was out of sight of the soldiers who
	guarded the gate, he quickened his pace, and at length, galloping at full
	speed, succeeded in gaining the mountains. Here he paused, and
	alighted at a solitary farm-house to breathe his panting steed; but had
	scarce put foot to ground when he heard the distant sound of pursuit, and
	beheld a horseman spurring up the mountain.</p>

	<p>Throwing himself again upon his steed, he abandoned the road and
	galloped across the rugged heights. The deep dry channel of a torrent
	checked his career, and his horse, stumbling upon the margin, rolled
	with his rider to the bottom. Pelistes was sorely bruised by the fall,
	and his whole visage was bathed in blood. His horse, too, was
	maimed and unable to stand, so that there was no hope of escape. The
	enemy drew near, and proved to be no other than Magued, the renegado
	general, who had perceived him as he issued forth from the city, and
	had followed singly in pursuit. &#8216;Well met, se√±or alcayde!&#8217; exclaimed
	he, &#8216;and overtaken in good time. Surrender yourself my prisoner.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Pelistes made no other reply than by drawing his sword, bracing his
	shield, and preparing for defence. Magued, though an apostate, and a
	fierce warrior, possessed some sparks of knightly magnanimity. Seeing
	his adversary dismounted, he disdained to take him at a disadvantage,
	but alighting, tied his horse to a tree.</p>

	<p>The conflict that ensued was desperate and doubtful, for seldom had
	two warriors met so well matched or of equal prowess. Their shields
	were hacked to pieces, the ground was strewed with fragments of their
	armor, and stained with their blood. They paused repeatedly to take
	breath; regarding each other with wonder and admiration. Pelistes,
	however, had been previously injured by his fall, and fought to great
	disadvantage. The renegado perceived it, and sought not to slay him,
	but to take him alive. Shifting his ground continually, he wearied his
	antagonist, who was growing weaker and weaker from the loss of blood.
	At length Pelistes seemed to summon up all his remaining strength to
	make a signal blow; it was skilfully parried and he fell prostrate upon
	the ground. The renegado ran up, and, putting his foot upon his
	sword, and the point of his scimitar to his throat, called upon him to ask
	his life; but Pelistes lay without sense, and as one dead. Magued then
	unlaced the helmet of his vanquished enemy and seated himself on a
	rock beside him, to recover breath. In this situation the warriors were
	<a class="pagenum" id="page576" title="576">&nbsp;</a>found by certain Moorish cavaliers, who marvelled much at the traces
	of that stern and bloody combat.</p>

	<p>Finding there was yet life in the Christian knight, they laid him upon
	one of their horses, and, aiding Magued to remount his steed, proceeded
	slowly to the city. As the convoy passed by the convent, the cavaliers
	looked forth and beheld their commander borne along bleeding and a captive.
	Furious at the sight, they sallied forth to the rescue, but were repulsed
	by a superior force, and driven back to the great portal of the
	church. The enemy entered pell mell with them, fighting from aisle
	to aisle, from altar to altar, and in the courts and cloisters of the convent.
	The greater part of the cavaliers died bravely, sword in hand;
	the rest were disabled with wounds and made prisoners. The convent,
	which was lately their castle, was now made their prison, and in after-times,
	in commemoration of this event, was consecrated by the name of
	St. George of the Captives.</p>

	<p>The loyalty and the prowess of the good knight Pelistes had gained
	him the reverence even of his enemies. He was for a long time disabled
	by his wounds, during which he was kindly treated by the Arab
	chieftains, who strove by every courteous means to cheer his sadness
	and make him forget that he was a captive. When he was recovered
	from his wounds they gave him a magnificent banquet to testify their
	admiration of his virtues.</p>

	<p>Pelistes appeared at the banquet clad in sable armor, and with a
	countenance pale and dejected; for the ills of his country evermore
	preyed upon his heart. Among the assembled guests was Count Julian,
	who held a high command in the Moslem army, and was arrayed in
	garments of mingled Christian and Morisco fashion. Pelistes had been
	a close and bosom friend of Julian in former times, and had served with
	him in the wars in Africa; but when the count advanced to accost him
	with his wonted amity, he turned away in silence, and deigned not to
	notice him; neither during the whole of the repast did he address to
	him ever a word, but treated him as one unknown.</p>

	<p>When the banquet was nearly at a close, the discourse turned upon
	the events of the war; and the Moslem chieftains, in great courtesy,
	dwelt upon the merits of many of the Christian cavaliers who had fallen
	in battle, and all extolled the valor of those who had recently perished
	in the defence of the convent. Pelistes remained silent for a time, and
	checked the grief which swelled within his bosom as he thought of his
	devoted cavaliers. At length, lifting up his voice, &#8216;Happy are the
	dead,&#8217; said he, &#8216;for they rest in peace, and are gone to receive the reward
	of their piety and valor! I could mourn over the loss of my companions
	in arms, but they have fallen with honor, and are spared the
	wretchedness I feel in witnessing the thraldom of my country. I have
	seen my only son, the pride and hope of my age, cut down at my side;
	I have beheld kindred friends and followers falling one by one around
	me, and have become so seasoned to those losses that I have ceased to
	weep. Yet there is one man over whose loss I will never cease to
	grieve. He was the loved companion of my youth, and the steadfast
	associate of my graver years. He was one of the most loyal of Christian
	knights. As a friend he was loving and sincere; as a warrior his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page577" title="577">&nbsp;</a>achievements were above all praise. What has become of him, alas! I
	know not. If fallen in battle, and I knew where his bones were laid,
	whether bleaching on the plains of Xeres, or buried in the waters of the
	Gaudalete, I would seek them out and enshrine them as the relics of a
	sainted patriot. Or if, like many of his companions in arms, he should
	be driven to wander in foreign lands, I would join him in his hapless
	exile, and we would mourn together over the desolation of our country!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Even the hearts of the Arab warriors were touched by the lament of
	the good Pelistes, and they said: &#8216;Who was this peerless friend, in
	whose praise thou art so fervent?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;His name,&#8217; replied Pelistes, &#8216;was Count Julian.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The Moslem warriors stared with surprise. &#8216;Noble cavalier,&#8217; exclaimed
	they, &#8216;has grief disordered thy senses? Behold thy friend,
	living and standing before thee, and yet thou dost not know him! This,
	this is Count Julian!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Upon this, Pelistes turned his eyes upon the count, and regarded him
	for a time, with a lofty and stern demeanor; and the countenance of
	Julian darkened, and was troubled, and his eye sank beneath the regard
	of that loyal and honorable cavalier. And Pelistes said, &#8216;In the name
	of God, I charge thee, man unknown! to answer. Dost thou presume
	to call thyself Count Julian?&#8217;</p>

	<p>The count reddened with anger at these words. &#8216;Pelistes,&#8217; said he,
	&#8216;what means this mockery? Thou knowest me well; thou knowest
	me for Count Julian?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I know thee for a base imposter!&#8217; cried Pelistes. &#8216;Count Julian
	was a noble Gothic knight; but thou appearest in mongrel Moorish
	garb. Count Julian was a Christian, faithful and devout; but I behold
	in thee a renegado and an infidel. Count Julian was ever loyal
	to his king, and foremost in his country&#8217;s cause: were he living, he
	would be the first to put shield on neck and lance in rest, to clear the
	land of her invaders: but thou art a hoary traitor! thy hands are
	stained with the royal blood of the Goths, and thou hast betrayed thy
	country and thy God. Therefore, I again repeat, man unknown! if
	thou sayest thou art Count Julian, thou liest! My friend, alas! is dead;
	and thou art some fiend from hell, which has taken possession of his
	body to dishonor his memory and render him an abhorrence among men!&#8217;
	So saying, Pelistes turned his back upon the traitor, and went forth
	from the banquet; leaving Count Julian overwhelmed with confusion,
	and an object of scorn to all the Moslem cavaliers.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> reception given to our notice of this serial work in our last number, has emboldened
	us to refer to the issues which have since appeared, containing a copious variety of matter
	which will be new to great numbers of our readers. One of the best evidences of the
	<em>naturalness</em> and ease of our author&#8217;s writings, is to be found in the ready appreciation of
	them by all classes of readers. Whether the vein be a serious one, or the theme turn upon
	the humorous or the burlesque, it is not too much, we think, to say that the writer takes
	always with him the heart or the fancy of the reader. Without however pausing to characterize
	productions which bid fair to become very widely and favorably known, we shall
	venture, under favor of the reader, to present a few more extracts, &#8216;which it is hoped may
	please.&#8217; The following illustration of a night-scene at the Kaatskill Mountain-House, on
	the evening of the Fourth of July, we can aver to be a faithful Daguerreotype sketch, for
	we saw it with the writer:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Take</span> my arm, and step forth with me from the piazza of the Mountain-House. It is night. A
		few stars are peering from a dim azure field of western sky; the high-soaring breeze, the breath of
		heaven, makes a stilly music in the neighboring pines; the meek crest of Dian rolls along the blue
		depths of ether, tinting with silver lines the half dun, half fleecy clouds; they who are in the parlors
		make &#8216;considerable&#8217; noise; there is an individual at the end of the portico discussing his quadruple
		julep, and another devotedly sucking the end of a cane, as if it were full of mother&#8217;s milk; he hummeth
		also an air from <cite>Il Pirata</cite>, and wonders, in the simplicity of his heart, &#8216;why the devil that there
		steam-boat from Albany doesn&#8217;t begin to show its lights down on the Hudson.&#8217; His companion of
		the glass, however, is intent on the renewal thereof. Calling to him the chief &#8216;help&#8217; of the place, he
		says: &#8216;Is that other antifogmatic ready?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;No, Sir.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, now, person, what&#8217;s the reason? What was my last observation? Says I to you, says I,
		&#8216;Make me a fourth of them beverages;&#8217; and moreover, I added, &#8216;Just you keep doing so; be <em>constantly</em>
		making them, till the order is countermanded.&#8217; Give us another; go! vanish!&#8212;&#8216;disappear
		and appear!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8216;The obsequious servant went; and returning with the desired draught, observed, probably for the
		thousandth time: &#8216;There! that&#8217;s what I call the true currency; them&#8217;s the <em>ginooyne</em> mint-drops;
		<span class="small_all_caps">HA</span>&#8212;<em>ha</em>&#8212;ha!&#8217;&#8212;these separate divisions of his laughter coming out of his mouth at intervals of about
		half a minute each.</p>

		<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">There</span> is a bench near the verge of the Platform, where, when you sit at evening, the hollow-sounding
		air comes up from the vast vale below, like the restless murmurs of the ocean. Anchor
		yourself here for a while, reader, with me. It being the evening of the national anniversary, a few
		patriotic individuals are extremely busy in piling up a huge pyramid of dried pine branches, barrels
		covered with tar, and kegs of spirits, to a height of some fifteen or twenty feet&#8212;perhaps higher. A
		bonfire is premeditated. You shall see anon, how the flames will rise. The preparations are completed;
		the fire is applied. Hear how it crackles and hisses! Slowly but spitefully it mounts from
		limb to limb, and from one combustible to another, until the whole welkin is a-blaze, and shaking as
		with thunder! It is a beautiful sight. The gush of unwonted radiance rolls in effulgent surges
		adown the vale. How the owl hoots with surprise at the interrupting light! Bird of wisdom, it is
		the Fourth! and you may well add your voice to swell the choral honors of the time. How the tall
		old pines, withered by the biting scathe of Eld, rise to the view, afar and near; white shafts, bottomed
		in darkness, and standing like the serried spears of an innumerable army! The groups around the
		beacon are gathered together, but are forced to enlarge the circle of their acquaintance, by the growing
		intensity of the increasing blaze. Some of them, being ladies, their white robes waving in the mountain
		<a class="pagenum" id="page579" title="579">&nbsp;</a>breeze, and the light shining full upon them, present, you observe, a beautiful appearance. The
		pale pillars of the portico flash fitfully into view, now seen and gone, like columns of mist. The
		swarthy African who kindled the fire regards it with perspiring face and grinning ivories; and lo!
		the man who hath mastered the quintupled glass of metamorphosed <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">eau-de-vie</em>, standing by the
		towering pile of flame, and, reaching his hand on high, he smiteth therewith his sinister pap, with a
		most hollow sound; the knell, as it were of his departing reason. In short, he is making an oration!</p>

		<p>&#8216;Listen to those voiceful currents of air, traversing the vast profound below the Platform! What
		a mighty circumference do they sweep! Over how many towns, and dwellings, and streams, and incommunicable
		woods! Murmurs of the dark, sources and awakeners of sublime imagination, swell
		from afar. You have thoughts of eternity and power here, which shall haunt you evermore. But we
		must be early stirrers in the morning. Let us to bed.</p>

		<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You can lie on your pillow at the Kaatskill House, and see the god of day look upon you from
		behind the pinnacles of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, hundreds of miles away. Noble
		prospect! As the great orb heaves up in ineffable grandeur, he seems rising from beneath you, and
		you fancy that you have attained an elevation where may be seen <em>the motion of the world</em>. No intervening
		land to limit the view, you seem suspended in mid-air, without one obstacle to check the eye.
		The scene is indescribable. The chequered and interminable vale, sprinkled with groves, and lakes,
		and towns, and streams; the mountains afar off, swelling tumultuously heavenward, like waves of
		the ocean, some incarnadined with radiance, others purpled in shade; all these, to use the language
		of an auctioneer&#8217;s advertisement, &#8216;are too tedious to mention, but may be seen on the premises.&#8217; I
		know of but one picture which will give the reader an idea of this etherial spot. It was the view
		which the angel Michael was polite enough, one summer morning, to point out to Adam, from the
		highest hill of Paradise.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Many and many a young father will recognize, in the following, his own emotions, as he
	looks in moments of thoughtfulness upon the little &#8216;olive-branches&#8217; around him, in whom
	he lives over again his own earliest years:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">To</span> those who are disposed to glean philosophy from the mayhap less noticeable objects of this
		busy world, there are few sights more lovely than childhood. The little cherub who now sits at my
		knee, and tries, with tiny effort, to clutch the quill with which I am playing for you, good reader;
		whose capricious taste, varying from ink-stand to paper, and from that to books, and every other
		portable thing&#8212;all &#8216;moveables that I could tell you of&#8217;&#8212;he has in his little person those elements
		which constitute both the freshness of our sublunary mortality, and that glorious immortality which
		the mortal shall yet put on. Gazing upon his fair young brow, his peach-like cheek, and the depths
		of those violet eyes, I feel myself rejuvenated. That which bothered Nicodemus, is no marvel to me.
		I feel that I have a new existence; nor can I dispel the illusion. It is harder, indeed, to believe that
		he will ever be what I am, than that I am otherwise than he is now. I can not imagine that he will
		ever become a pilous adult, with harvests for the razor on that downy chin. Will those golden locks
		become the brown auburn? Will that forehead rise as a varied and shade-changing record of pleasure
		or care? Will the classic little lips, now colored as by the radiance of a ruby, ever be fitfully
		bitten in the glow of literary composition!&#8212;and will those sun-bright locks, which hang about his
		temples like the soft lining of a summer cloud, become meshes where hurried fingers shall thread
		themselves in play? By the mass, I can not tell. But this I know. That which hath been, shall be:
		the lot of manhood, if he live, will be upon him; the charm, the obstacle, the triumphant fever; the
		glory, the success, the far-reaching thoughts,</p>

	<p>The &#8216;Ollapodiana&#8217; papers are concluded in the third number, and a portion of the issue
	is devoted to the commencement of the &#8216;Miscellaneous Prose Papers&#8217; of the writer, which
	are both numerous and various, &#8216;A Chapter on Cats&#8217; records an amusing story, replete
	with incident, which turns upon the deplorable consequences, in one sad instance at least,
	of cat-killing. An illustrative although not satisfactory passage is subjoined:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I am</span> subject, in summer, to restlessness. Thick-coming fancies mar my rest, and my ear is peculiarly
		sensitive to the least inappropriate sound. One sultry evening in July, I returned home later
		than usual, from an arbitration, wherein I lost a cause on which I had counted certainly to win. I
		suspect I bored the arbitrators with too long a plea, and too voluminous quotations of precedents; for
		when I finished, two were asleep, and most of the others yawning. They decided against my client,
		and I came home mad with chagrin, and crept into bed, longing for speedy oblivion in the arms of
		Sleep.                          </p>

		<p>&#8216;But that calm sister of Death would not be won to my embrace. I lay tossing for a long time in
		&#8216;restless ecstacy,&#8217; until vexed and overwearied nature at last sunk to repose. I could not have slumbered
		over ten minutes, before I was awakened by the most outrageous caterwauling that ever stung
		the human ear. I arose in a fury, and looked out of the window. All was still. The cause for outcry
		appeared to have ceased. Now and then there was a low gutteral wail, between a suppressed
		grunt and a squeal; but it was so faint that nothing could have lived &#8216;twixt that and silence. After a
		listening probation of a few minutes, I slunk back into my sheets.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I had scarcely dozed a quarter of an hour, when the obnoxious vociferations arose again. They
		were fierce, ill-natured, and shrill. I arose again, vexed beyond endurance. All was quiet in a moment.
		I am not given to profanity; I deem it foolish and wicked; but on this occasion, after stretching
		<a class="pagenum" id="page580" title="580">&nbsp;</a>my body like a sheeted ghost, half out of the window, and gazing into the shadows of the garden
		to discover the object of my annoyance, I exclaimed in a loud and spiteful voice, which expressed my
		concentrated hate:</p>

		<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;<em>D&#8212;n that cat!</em>&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Young gentleman,&#8217; said a passing guardian of the night, from the street, &#8216;you had better pop your
		head in and stop your noise. If you don&#8217;t, you will rue it; now mind-I-tell-ye.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Look here, old Charley,&#8217; said I, in return, &#8216;don&#8217;t be impertinent. It is your business to preserve
		the peace, and to obviate every evil that looks disgracious in the city&#8217;s eye. You guard the slumbers
		of her citizens; and if you expect a dollar from me at Christmas, for the poetry in your next annual
		address, you will perform what I now request, and what it is your solemn and bounded duty to do.
		Spring your rattle; comprehend that vagrom cat, and take her to the watch-house, I will appear as
		plaintiff against the quadruped, before the mayor, in the morning. Her character is bad&#8212;her habits
		are scandalous.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Oh, pshaw!&#8217; said the watchman, and went clattering up the street, singing &#8216;N&#8217;hav p-a-st dwelve
		o&#8217;glock, and a glowdee morn.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I reverted to my pillow, and fell into a train of conjectures touching the grimalkin. Possibly it
		might be the darling old friend of Miss Dillon. Then I thought of others&#8212;then I slept.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I cannot declare to a second how long my fitful slumber lasted, before I was startled from my bed
		by a yell, which proceeded apparently from a cat in my room. I had just been dreaming of a great
		mouser, with ears like a jackass, and claws, armed with long &#8216;pickers and stingers,&#8217; sitting on my
		bosom, and sucking away my breath. I sprang at once into the middle of the room. I searched every
		where&#8212;nothing was in the apartment. Then there rushed toward the zenith one universal cat-shriek,
		which went echoing off on the night-wind like the reverberation of a sharp thunder-peal.</p>

		<p>&#8216;My blood was now <em>up</em> for vengeance. One hungry and fiery wish to destroy that diabolical caterwauler,
		took possession of my soul. At that instant the clock struck one. It was the death knell of
		the feline vocalist. I looked out of the window, and in the light of a stray lot of moonshine, streaming
		through the tall chimneys to the south-east, I saw Miss Dillon&#8217;s romantic favorite, alternately cooing
		and fighting with a large mouser of the neighborhood, that I had seen for several afternoons previous,
		walking leisurely along the garden wall, as if absorbed in deep meditation, and forming some libertine
		resolve. In fine, they each seemed saturate with the spirit of the Gnome king, Umbriel, in the
		drama, when he</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p class="i12">&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;stalked abroad</p>
				<p>Urging the wolf to tear the buffalo.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;The death of one of these noisy belligerents being determined on, I looked round my room for the
		tools of retribution. Not a moveable thing, however, could I discover, save a new pitcher, which had
		been sent home that very day, and to which my name and address were appended on a bit of card. I
		clutched it with desperate fury, and pouring into my bowl the water contained in it, I poised it in my
		hand for the deadly heave. I had been a member of a quoit club in the country, and the principles of
		a clever throw were familiar to me. I resolved to make the vessel describe what is called in philosophy
		a <em>parabolic curve</em>, so that while it knocked out the brains of one combatant, it should effectually
		admonish the survivor of the iniquity of his doings. I approached the window&#8212;balanced the pitcher&#8212;and
		then drave it home. Its reception was acknowledged by a loud, choking squall&#8212;a faint
		yell of agony, and then a respectful silence. Satisfied that my pitcher had been broken at the fountain
		of life, and that the silent tabby would not soon tune her pipes again, I retired to bed, and slept
		with the serenity and comfort of one who is conscious of having performed a virtuous action.</p>

		<p>&#8216;In the morning, the cat was found &#8216;keeled up&#8217; on a bed of pinks, with her head broken in, and her
		ancient and venerable whiskers dabbled in blood. The shattered pitcher lay by her side. The vessel
		had done its worst&#8212;so had my victim.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The story proper, upon the consecutive incidents of which we shall not touch, closes with
	the annexed whimsical anecdote:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">An</span> anonymous wag not long ago, placed an advertisement in each of our city journals, signed by
		an eminent house on the Delaware wharf, and stating that <span class="special_emphasis">Five Hundred Cats</span> were wanted immediately
		by the firm. The said firm in the meantime knew nothing of the matter.</p>

		<p>&#8216;On visiting their counting-house the next morning, the partners found the streets literally blocked
		up with enterprising cat-sellers. Huge negroes were there, each with ten or fifteen sage, grave tabbies
		tied together with a string. Old market-women had brought thither whole families of the feline genus,
		from the superannuated <em>Tom</em>, to the blind kitten. The air resounded with the squallings of the quadrupedal
		multitude. New venders, with their noisy property, were seen thronging to the place from
		every avenue.</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;What&#8217;ll you <em>guv</em> me for this &#8217;ere lot?&#8217; said a tall shad-woman, pressing up toward the counting-room.
		&#8216;The newspapers says you allows liberal prices. I axes a dollar a piece for the old &#8217;uns, and
		five levys for the kittens.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;You have been fooled,&#8217; said the chief partner, who appeared with a look of dismay at the door,
		and was obliged to speak as loud amid the din as a sea-captain in a storm. &#8216;I want no cats. I have
		no use for them. I could not eat them. I couldn&#8217;t sell them. I never advertised for them.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;A decided mendicant, a member of the great family of loafers, with a red, <em>bulgy</em> nose, and bloated
		cheeks, who had three cats tied to a string in his hand, now mounted a cotton bale, and producing a
		newspaper, spelt the advertisement through as audibly as he could under the circumstances, demanding
		of the assembly as he closed, &#8216;if that there advertysement wasn&#8217;t a true bill?&#8217; An unanimous
		&#8216;Sarting!&#8217; echoed through the crowd. Encouraged by the electric response, the loafer proceeded to
		make a short speech. He touched upon the rights of trade, the liberty of the press, the importance
		of fair dealing, and the benefits of printing; and concluded by advising his hearers to go the death
		for their rights, and &#8216;not to stand no humbug.&#8217; Such was the effect of his eloquence, that the firm
		<a class="pagenum" id="page581" title="581">&nbsp;</a>against which he wielded his oratorical thunder found it necessary to compromise matters by treating
		the entire concourse to a hogshead of wine. &#8216;The company separated at an early hour,&#8217; consoled for
		the loss of their bargains and the emptiness of their pockets by the lightsomeness of their heads and
		hearts.&#8217;</p>

	their Influence on Health and the Duration of Life. By <span class="special_name">William Sweetser, M. D.</span> In
	one volume. pp. 270. New-York: <span class="special_name">J. and H. G. Langley</span>.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">This</span> is a work destined, as we can easily foresee, to produce great good. Its leading
	design, as its title implies, and as is stated indeed by the author in his preface, is to elucidate
	the influence of intellect and passion upon the health and endurance of the human
	organization; an influence which has been but imperfectly understood and appreciated in
	its character and importance, by mankind at large. The volume under notice is divided
	into two parts. Under the first are considered the intellectual operations in respect to their
	influence on the general functions of the body; under the second is embraced a view of
	the moral feelings or passions, in the relation which they also sustain to our physical nature.
	Of these a concise definition is offered, with such classification as is necessary to the leading
	design of the work. Their effects upon the different functions of the animal economy are
	next noticed; and a description is given of a few of the most important passions belonging
	to each of the three great classes; namely, pleasurable, painful and mixed, into which they
	are separated; their physical phenomena and individual influence on the well-being of
	the human mechanism being closely examined. A forcible exposition is also given of the
	evil consequences resulting from an ill-regulated imagination (acting through the instrumentality
	of the passions, morbidly excited by its licentious operation,) to the firmness of
	the nervous system, and the integrity of the general health. The volume is not addressed
	to any particular class of readers, and being free from technical expressions, is rendered
	plain and comprehensive to all. We commend this volume of Mr. <span class="special_name">Sweetser</span> cordially
	to our readers, firmly impressed with the belief that the principles which it advances may
	be rendered subservient both to the physical and moral welfare of our countrymen.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> fourth number of this very remarkable work has been published; and we have had
	a fair opportunity of testing the merits of the mysterious author. The circumstances must
	now be generally known, under which these works appear before the public. It appears
	that <span class="special_name">Mundt</span>, a German scholar, who is publishing a continuation of <span class="special_name">Schlegel&#8217;s</span> History
	of Literature, has in his delineations of character given almost unbounded praise to an
	American named <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>. Among the various works attributed to him are &#8216;Life in
	the New World,&#8217; &#8216;Sea, Sketches,&#8217; &#8216;South and North,&#8217; &#8216;Virey,&#8217; the &#8216;Legitimate,&#8217; and others,
	which are to be issued in rapid succession from the press of <span class="special_name">Winchester</span>, &#8216;the indefatigable,&#8217;
	as he may well be called; for the rapidity with which he sends out to the world
	the literary novelties of the day is a theme of public marvel. The German, in which these
	volumes are written, is said by competent judges, to be very pure and powerful: and indeed
	we may rest assured that if the case were otherwise, a critic of such high reputation
	as <span class="special_name">Mundt</span> would never have spoken of <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> in such enthusiastic terms. The publisher,
	we understand, obtained several of the works from the library of Columbia College,
	through the politeness of Professor <span class="special_name">Tellkampt</span>.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page582" title="582">&nbsp;</a>The opinion, which some have expressed, that <span class="special_name">Seatsfield&#8217;s</span> books are made up of
	stolen selections from different American writers, is unfounded. We cannot recognize in
	his style or thought familiar passages; and beside, there does not appear to be any rational
	inducement for this species of plagiarism. It is evident that the writings are indeed what
	they appear to be, the genuine productions of an able man. The descriptions of natural
	scenery are very graphic. &#8216;The first trip on the Red River,&#8217; and the description of the
	trappers, is one of the most animated sketches we have ever read. Our mountains, rivers,
	cataracts, ocean-lakes, and forests, are described with the most remarkable spirit and
	truth.&#8217; The translation, we are informed by the best judges, is extremely faithful.</p>

	<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">Poetry and History of Wyoming</span>. By <span class="special_name">William L. Stone</span>, Esq. Second edition, enlarged.
	New-York: <span class="special_name">Mark H. Newman</span>.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">This</span> indefatigable laborer in the mine of Indian history continues to throw off from time
	to time works upon that subject, which bear the marks of great industry, patient research,
	and extensive information, and which have deservedly given him a high literary reputation
	as an historical writer. What has yet appeared we believe is only the beginning of a series
	of works relating to Indian annals, which are to be completed as soon as the author&#8217;s
	health, and the duties of an arduous profession, will allow. From a late honor conferred
	upon him by one of the remnants of the Six Nations, in electing him one of their chiefs, by
	the name of <span class="special_name">Sa-go-sen-o-ta</span>, it seems plain that they highly approve of his efforts to preserve
	their history; and it may be considered as endorsing the accuracy of his investigations.
	In this light, the honor conferred, though coming from those whom civilization is crushing
	beneath its superior intelligence and power, is valuable and important. The present book
	takes the poetical share of its title from the fact that the author has prefixed <span class="special_name">Campbell&#8217;s</span>
	celebrated poem, preceded by a sketch of his life, furnished by <span class="special_name">Washington Irving</span>.
	&#8216;Gertrude of Wyoming,&#8217; though beautiful, and seeming to be a narrative of real incidents in
	a poetical dress, is nevertheless a fiction, albeit founded upon an actual tragedy, whose
	horrors can hardly be exaggerated by any pen. It has been the design of our author to record
	the real history of the section of country which was stained by this tragedy, and which
	for this reason, has a melancholy interest thrown over its natural charms.</p>

	<p>The history of Wyoming does not commence, as many suppose, with the war of the
	American revolution. Long before, the conflict of human passions in the breast of savage
	and civilized man had discolored its soil with blood. During this antecedent period, its
	aboriginal annals are replete with incidents, which were greatly multiplied after the civil
	wars which disturbed the repose of that secluded valley had begun to be waged between
	the rival claimants to the territory from Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and which for
	twelve or thirteen years prior to the revolutionary war present a series of the most stirring
	events. The author, therefore, in order to render the history complete, has taken it up before
	the first known visit of the white men; of whom, among the earliest, were the Moravian
	missionaries. To the honor of these men, be it recorded, that in this instance, as in
	others, they plunged into the depths of the forest, and labored among the savages with a
	christian zeal and enterprize which have never been surpassed. The scenes of the revolution,
	embracing not only the great massacre in July, 1778, with its frightful horrors, but also
	a number of other bloody forays of the Indians upon the white men, are moreover faithfully
	described. But after all, perhaps the most interesting portion of the volume is formed of
	the narrative of the services and sufferings of individuals and families. These latter records
	are full of those wild and romantic incidents which are peculiar to border warfare;
	where the steady courage and determined bravery of the European appears in deadly conflict
	with the wiliness, cunning, and sleepless vengeance of the savage. To say that all
	this is narrated by the author in the spirit of accurate history, would be far below the meed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page583" title="583">&nbsp;</a>of praise that is due. He has executed this part of the book in a style of animated and
	lively description, and with that flowing and finished diction, which can only be attained
	when the mind of a writer is perfectly familiar with the events, and when, by the force of
	imagination, he becomes himself as it were an actor instead of a spectator of the scenes
	which he narrates.</p>

	<p>Additional interest is given to this spot, from the fact, which probably is not generally
	known, except to the professed historian, that the distinguished patriot <span class="special_name">Timothy Pickering</span>
	took up his abode in the valley of Wyoming, attracted no doubt by its unrivalled
	beauties, to which he was first introduced during a military campaign, but which he afterward
	contemplated, on the return of peace, with an eye capable of being charmed by the
	picturesque in nature. The concluding chapter of the book is devoted mainly to a spirited
	account of the abduction of that gentleman, and his confinement in the wilderness
	by a gang of ruffians, who, after trying in vain to bend his soldier-like mind to a compliance
	with their violent designs, gave him an ungracious release, and allowed him to return
	to his family. Among the papers in the appendix, now first introduced to the public, will
	be found a deed of purchase, made from the Indians ninety years ago, by the Connecticut
	Land Company, containing the names of some six hundred of the most wealthy and distinguished
	people of that State. It is important as a means of showing the valuation of land
	at that period, and a proof that it was acquired by honest purchase. This edition has
	been enlarged to the amount of more than one hundred pages of letter-press; an addition
	found necessary by the discovery of increased materials by the author since the publication
	of the first edition.</p>

	<p>In concluding this brief notice of a work written with decided talent, and designed to fill
	an important niche in the early history of this country, we are bound to thank the author, and
	to express the hope that he will be able to finish the historical design which he has sketched,
	pertaining to that interesting race, of whom it may be truly said, that &#8216;the hour of their destiny
	has already struck.&#8217; This volume shows us, that in our own country may be found
	topics for literary effort, worthy of employing the gifted pens of America, without going
	abroad in quest of subjects, in the discussion of which we shall long be surpassed by
	foreigners, on account of their superior facilities and larger sources of information. As a book
	entirely American, we commend it to the reading public, confident that it will be received
	with favor wherever it is read, and be considered a valuable addition to the historical
	department of every gentleman&#8217;s library.</p>

	&#8216;Spirit of the Age,&#8217; a brilliant work, to which the present bears slight resemblance. We
	quite agree with a contemporary, that it manifests little or no independence of judgment or
	originality of thought. &#8216;It is the result of the labor of many hands, and those not the most
	skilful or experienced. It consequently wants that homogenousness of style which one
	would expect in a professed imitation of so excellent a model. The highest degree of merit
	that can be accorded to it is that of a collection of magazine articles of second rate merit.
	It is likely to prove popular with the generality of readers who do not trouble themselves to
	dip beneath the surface of things; but we must caution those who would form a just estimate
	of the characters and merits of the distinguished writers whose works are analyzed
	in it, that its premises are not always correct nor its deductions sound.&#8217;</p>

	<div class="ed_table_item">
		<p><span class="ed_table_title">A day with the great Seatsfield.</span>&#8212;The Boston Daily Advertiser recently divulged,
		with a most curious air of bewilderment, the name of a new, and as it seems hitherto
		unheard-of, ornament to American literature&#8212;the illustrious <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>. Illustrious, however,
		only upon the other side of the water; for it appears that we Yankee cotton-raisers
		have somewhat else to do than to busy our brains about any letters except letters of credit,
		or any fame that is not reverberated from abroad. No one, of course, at all conversant
		with modern German literature, not even the slightest skimmer of their late periodical publications,
		or the most occasional peruser of the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Zeitung</cite> or <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dresden Bluthundstaglich</cite>,
		can have failed to notice with patriotic pride the gradual but gigantic progress of
		this new <span class="special_name">Voltaire</span> to the highest pinnacle of popular renown. But, sooth to say, our
		western world is so overrun with pretenders; there are so many young gentlemen annually
		spawned by Yale and Cambridge, who affect to read German without being able to construe
		the advertisement of a Leipsic bookseller; so numerous are the blue-spectacled
		nymphs who quote <span class="special_name">Jean Paul</span> betwixt their blanc-mange and oysters, without comprehending
		even the outermost rind of its in-meaning; so utterly ignorant are our so-called
		literati of any subject beyond the scope of a newspaper, that the name of <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>
		sounded as strangely in American ears as if he had lately arrived from Herschel or Georgium
		Sidus in a balloon. It is true that some two or three of our eminent scholars, a few
		travellers, men of taste, who had wandered by the Rhine, were acquainted with his reputation,
		and in some degree with his productions. <span class="special_name">Emerson</span> doubtless must have been
		aware of his renown; Professor <span class="special_name">Felton</span> of course had read him as often as he has <span class="special_name">Homer</span>;
		<span class="special_name">Jones</span>, <span class="special_name">Wilkins</span>, and <span class="special_name">F. Smith</span> had studied him with delight. The &#8216;Dial,&#8217; a journal of
		much repute, had even spoken openly, we are told, of his success in Europe. Mr. <span class="special_name">W. E.
		Channing</span>, the poet, had evidently but perhaps unconsciously imitated his peculiar viscidity
		of style, and (if we may use such an expression.) extreme flakiness of thought. But in
		spite of these few exceptions to the general indifference, let it stand recorded, that when
		the name of <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> returned to his own shore, it was an alien and unmeaning word.
		His own country, so deeply indebted to his powerful pen, absolutely knew him not. The
		literati stared, and the Boston Advertiser was struck aghast with wonder. What a comment
		upon the state of letters in America! &#8216;Literary Emporium,&#8217; forsooth! &#8216;Western
		Athens!&#8217; Medici of Manhattan! how grossly we Yankees do misapply titles! It was the
		very &#8216;Literary Emporium&#8217; itself that was most astounded at the newly-discovered mine.
		<span class="special_name">Seatsfield&#8217;s</span> name had overspread civilized Europe; his productions had been dramatized
		at Munich and Bucharest; they had been translated into Russian and Turkish; the
		Maltese mariner had learned to solace himself with his &#8216;Twilight Helmsman&#8217;s Hymn,&#8217;
		and the merchants of Syra and Beyrout adorned their mansions with his bust; yet Boston,
		New-York, and Philadelphia had never heard his name! In the lack of more minute information
		with regard to this remarkable man, perhaps the following page or two from a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page585" title="585">&nbsp;</a>traveller&#8217;s journal may prove acceptable to the public. The absolutely total obscurity of
		the subject in America, may also, it is hoped, serve as an apology for the openness of detail
		and apparent breach of etiquette in regard to private intercourse.</p>

		<p class="post_break_small">&#8216;<span class="first_word">It</span> has been my fortune to spend a day in company with the man who of all men has
		done the most to illustrate our manners and character; yet who, strange to say, is less
		known than &#8216;Professor&#8217; <span class="special_name">Ingraham</span>. As it was then my fortune to speak <em>with</em> him; I now

		<p>&#8216;In the spring of the year previous to this, or to be exact, in April, 1843, I found myself
		at Berlin. My friend, Mr. <span class="special_name">Carlyle</span>, of London, had given me a letter to <span class="special_name">Theodore
		Mundt</span>, and I had learned soon after my arrival that this distinguished man was in town.
		I had consequently looked over my letters, after dinner, and had selected the one addressed
		to <span class="special_name">Mundt</span>, and laid it under a little plaster bust of <span class="special_name">Schiller</span> that stood just over the stove,
		in the room where I dined. In the evening I walked into the <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ermschlagg Buchzimmer</em>.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="A new public library and reading-room in Berlin." class="fnmarker">2</a>
		Several students were making annotations from huge volumes, and many grave, pale gentlemen
		were turning over the reviews and periodicals of the day. Among these I recognized
		an Englishman whom I had fallen in with at Cologne but parted with at Heidelberg.
		He had been in Berlin three days before me, and I was truly glad to meet with an acquaintance
		even of so recent a date, to whom I could apply for information or advice as to the
		best way of seeing the lions. While I was whispering to him, a grim-visaged old Teuton
		looked up at us with a stern frown, and my friend observed, &#8216;We must retire into the <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sprechensaale</em>,
		or conversation-room.&#8217; As soon as we had entered this adjoining apartment, to
		the evident satisfaction of the aforesaid grim Teuton, I observed a tall, thin man, of angular
		and wiry aspect, see-sawing his body in front of the stove, toward which he had turned
		his back, as he stood in apparently deep cogitation. &#8216;You don&#8217;t know who that is,&#8217; quoth
		my friend; &#8216;there is <em>one</em> of the lions, to begin with. I found out his name this morning:
		that is <span class="special_name">Theodore Mundt</span>.&#8217; Struck as I was with the stranger&#8217;s aspect, which appeared
		to me altogether American, I stared at him till he suddenly raised his dark eyes, and fixed
		them on mine. To disembarrass myself from my seeming rudeness as politely as possible,
		I bowed to his gaze, and said inquiringly: &#8216;I have the honor to address Mr. <span class="special_name">Mundt</span>?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;You have the <em>luck</em>,&#8217; he said, &#8216;but the honor is <em>his</em>.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Honors are even, then,&#8217; said I, as brusquely as I dared; and of all animals a traveller
		is the most impudent. &#8216;I have in my pocket,&#8217; I continued, &#8216;a letter for you from my friend
		<span class="special_name">Carlyle</span>.&#8217; At the name of <span class="special_name">Carlyle</span> he raised his hands in surprise, then rubbed them
		with delight, and began to eulogise his friend.</p>

		<p>&#8216;All this while I was fumbling in my pocket for my letter, when suddenly it flashed over
		me that I had put it under the bust in the tavern. I grew confused for a moment, and then
		as Mynheer <span class="special_name">Mundt</span> held out his hand for the letter, I burst into a laugh, and confessed
		that I had left my letter at home. <span class="special_name">Mundt</span> looked very serious, and quoted from Othello,
		&#8216;That is a fault;&#8217; and then from Macbeth, &#8216;To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow.&#8217;
		I thought there was a little affectation in this; perhaps it was merely complimentary; but
		the immediate result of our imperfect acquaintance was, that I made bold to introduce my
		friend to <span class="special_name">Mundt</span>, who invited us both to his rooms to supper. On our way thither, as we
		passed the <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brunswik Gasthaus</em>, where I lodged, I stepped in to procure my letter, and
		<span class="special_name">Mundt</span> appeared rejoiced to hear directly from his &#8216;very <em>fine</em> friend&#8217; <span class="special_name">Carlyle</span>, as he
		queerly styled him.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I should feel that I was venturing on forbidden ground were I to reveal more of what
		passed between us that evening. There was some drawing of corks and some puffing of
		Hamburg-made Cheroots, which <span class="special_name">Mundt</span> declared to be genuine Oriental; there was a ham
		of Westphalia, and a bit of La Gruyere. But with all this we have nothing to do. I fear
		that I have already made my preface too long. Enough be it then to say, that <span class="special_name">Mundt</span>
		<a class="pagenum" id="page586" title="586">&nbsp;</a>first revealed to me on this occasion (I am ashamed to own it) the name and talents of our
		countryman <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>. How enthusiastic he was I will not describe; but his enthusiasm
		could only be equalled by his surprise that I was not familiar with his writings.</p>

		<p>&#8216;On the next day <span class="special_name">Mundt</span> gave me a letter to <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>, directed to him at B√¢sle, in
		Switzerland, near which he owns a beautiful villa. I did not find him at B√¢sle, however,
		and I proceeded to Milan without delivering my letter. On my return from Italy, I happened
		to learn that <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> was at Graffenburg in Silesia; and although it was forty
		leagues from my purposed route I encountered the delay, out of mere curiosity of seeing so
		distinguished a man. This time I was not disappointed. One day only I spent at Graffenburg,
		but that day was sufficient to fill me with a truly German (I wish I could say American)
		admiration of my countryman. Graffenburg, it should be remarked, is the famous scene
		of Doctor <span class="special_name">Priessnitz&#8217;s</span> wonderful hydropathic cures. Being there only for a single day, I
		did not think it best to submit in all points to the cold water treatment; neither did <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>,
		for I noticed that he mixed two table-spoonfuls of gin with every gill of cold water.
		<span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> is a man of about middle-age, with a penetrating eye, and rather a good
		form, though not unusually muscular. His face bears a remarkable resemblance to the
		pictures of <span class="special_name">Numa Pompilius</span>; the benign smile of each is the same. His chin is round and
		full, although partially concealed by a slight beard; his nose, which is of a truly German
		outline, is marked by the &#8216;dilated nostril of genius;&#8217; and his whole aspect is that of a
		thorough man of the world. I will continue my reminiscence by extracting verbatim a
		page or so from my imperfect, though as far as it goes, authentic diary. I am convinced
		however that his remarks will lose much from the want of his pointed manner of enunciation.
		His English was faultless, and he spoke as well as if he had never been out of
		America. Very few Americans indeed, and no British-Islanders, talk so correct and chaste
		a dialect.</p>


		<h3 class="subtitle">EXTRACT FROM MY JOURNAL.</h3>


		<p style="text-align:right;"><span class="dateline">Graffenburg, July 4, 1844.</span></p>

		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I was</span> very fortunate, they tell me, to find <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> in so companionable a mood.
		He appeared in high spirits, and was exceedingly conversible. The glorious return of our
		national anniversary had a visible effect upon him. I presented my letter to him last evening,
		but he was weary, and retired early. When I first met him in the Upper Bath-room
		Walk, this morning, he congratulated me upon the brightness and brilliancy of the day.
		&#8216;You have much to be thankful for, Sir,&#8217; he observed; &#8216;the day is perfectly American.
		Just such a sun as this is now dawning upon Broadway and the Battery. The sound of
		India-crackers and the pleasant smell of lobsters is already perceptible to the senses of the
		awakening Manhattanese.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Boston, too, my native city,&#8217; I observed, &#8216;is also alive to the holiday influences. Boston
		Common I dare say is already white with tents, and the fragrant commerce of the booths
		is just commencing on the Mall.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;Yes, Sir; but Boston and Philadelphia both fail in developing the true
		character-stamp-work (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">character-stampfen-werk</em>) of the day. To see the Fourth of July in
		its glory, one should visit New-York. To my senses, which are uncommonly acute, there
		is a peculiar smell about the Fourth of July in New-York, which differs in toto from that
		of any other holiday.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;In Boston we also have the perfume of lobsters and egg-pop blended with that of orange-peel
		and pine-apple&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;That, Sir, is but a feeble rationale of the New-York savor. I have
		often, in a jocose mood, amused myself with analyzing this odor. I have resolved it into
		the following elements: lobsters, gunpowder, trampled-grass, wheel-grease, and cigars.
		It is mainly to these ingredients, grafted upon the other ordinary city smells, that I attribute
		the Fourth of July smell.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;There is one that you have failed to detect; namely, a faint whiff of barn-yards, owing
		I presume to the strong prevalence of farmers and other rustics from the surrounding country.&#8217;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page587" title="587">&nbsp;</a><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> smiled at this, and acknowledged, in a laughing way, an occasional intimation
		of manure. &#8216;Graffenburg,&#8217; I observed, &#8216;is remarkably free from all strong odors;
		it is a very clean village.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;That, Sir, is owing to the water: depend upon it, wherever water prevails
		neatness will ensue. Temperance and cleanliness go hand in hand. The ancients
		were a filthy race, and they were great wine-bibbers. What a condition of personal and
		mental nastiness is divulged by <span class="special_name">Horace</span> in his &#8216;Iter ad Brundusium;&#8217; yet <span class="special_name">Horace</span> was a
		choice specimen of a Roman gentleman.&#8217;               </p>

		<p>&#8216;Have you had any poets among you here? or is the hydropathic system too repugnant
		to their art?&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;Our countryman, <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>, was here not long since. I sat at table
		with him frequently; but never introduced myself to him.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Do you think highly of his powers?&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;As a prolific generator of novel life-images, no; but as a vivid delineator
		of the inner-thought principle, as an artistical displayer of the higher subjective mood, he
		is of the very first class. I honor <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;He is perhaps our smoothest versifier, next to <span class="special_name">Halleck</span>.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;Nay, he is the only one among us who can combine extreme polish and
		the utmost facility of flow with deep-seated reflection.&#8217; <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> then quoted, with a
		sublime energy, from the celebrated &#8216;Psalm of Life:&#8217;</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;&#8216;<span class="first_word">Not</span> enjoyment and not sorrow</p>
				<p class="i2">Is our destined end or way,</p>
				<p>But to act, that each to-morrow</p>
				<p class="i2">Find us farther than to-day.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;In the world&#8217;s broad field of battle,</p>
				<p class="i2">In the bivouac of life,</p>
				<p>Be not like dumb driven cattle,</p>
				<p class="i2">Be a hero in the strife.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Trust no Future, howe&#8217;er pleasant,</p>
				<p class="i2">Let the dead Past, bury its dead;</p>
				<p>Act, act in the glorious Present,</p>
				<p class="i2">Heart within and <span class="special_name">God</span> o&#8217;er head.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;You give the poet a great advantage,&#8217; I said, &#8216;in quoting his very finest production, and
		picking out the choicest stanzas. Beside, his theme here is one of so general a nature, and
		so familiar to philosophy, that it would be hard for any one to moralize upon it in verse
		without accidentally hitting upon some sublimity. The commonest intellect has lofty and
		awful thoughts whenever it gives way to serious meditation upon our mortality.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;That is partly true; but <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> is not only great upon that
		ground. His realm is very extensive. No man has the power (had he only the will) of
		depicting the simplicity of every-day life and objects with more grace or comprehensiveness.
		There are some touches in his &#8216;Village Blacksmith&#8217; inexpressibly beautiful, and
		worthy of <span class="special_name">Burns&#8217;</span> &#8216;Cotter&#8217;s Saturday Night:&#8217;</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">His</span> hair is crisp and black and long,</p>
			<p class="i2">His face is like the tan;</p>
			<p>His brow is wet with honest sweat,</p>
			<p class="i2">He earns whate&#8217;er he can,&#8217; etc.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>And then again:</p>


		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;He goes on Sunday to the Church,</p>
				<p class="i2">And sits among the boys;</p>
				<p>He hears the parson pray and preach,</p>
				<p class="i2">He hears his daughter&#8217;s voice</p>
				<p>Singing in the gallery,</p>
				<p class="i2">And it makes his heart rejoice.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> repeated these verses with much emotion; and I observed that a tear stood
		upon his lids. I therefore turned the conversation upon hydropathy, and introduced a quotation
		from <span class="special_name">Pindar</span>: <span title="ariston men hyd√¥r">Œ±œÅ·Ω∂œÉœÑŒøŒΩ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ</span>, <em>etc.</em></p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page588" title="588">&nbsp;</a><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;<span class="special_name">Pindar</span>, Sir, has expressed a great truth; but I think that <span class="special_name">Pierpont</span>
		has expressed it better. In his exquisite &#8216;Ode on the Opening of the Marlborough Temperance-House&#8217;
		how beautifully he says, after speaking in regard to the virtues of cold water:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Oh! had <span class="special_name">Eve&#8217;s</span> hair</p>
				<p class="i2">Been dressed in gin,</p>
				<p>Would she have been</p>
				<p class="i2">Reflected fair?&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;And then, after describing the beauty of Eden, with its rills and pellucid brooks bubbling
		through the fresh meads, he goes on:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Are not pure springs</p>
				<p class="i2">And chrystal wells</p>
				<p>The very things</p>
				<p class="i2">For our Hotels?&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;That, Sir, is excellent, and the somewhat homely imagery only enhances in my mind the
		truth of the sentiment. <span class="special_name">Pierpont</span>, Sir, is a very great man.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;As great as <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>?&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;No, Sir, perhaps not; there is a considerable difference of calibre between
		them. I should say now that <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> was a first-rate artist with a second-rate
		imagination, and that <span class="special_name">Pierpont</span> was only a second-rate artist with a first-rate fancy.
		There is no mistake in <span class="special_name">Pierpont</span>.&#8217;</p>

		<p>I smiled at <span class="special_name">Seatsfield&#8217;s</span> affectation of Americanisms, as if out of compliment to myself,
		or in honor of the day; and I rejoined: &#8216;There may be no mistake in <span class="special_name">Pierpont</span>, but there
		is one or two in <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;Grammatical or prosodiacal?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Neither; but in the beginning of his &#8216;Psalm of Life,&#8217; he says:</p>


		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Tell me not in mournful numbers</p>
				<p class="i2">Life is but an empty dream;</p>
				<p>For the soul is dead that slumbers,</p>
				<p class="i2">And things are not what they seem.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;Here he evidently meant things <em>are</em> what they seem; for in the next stanza he goes on to
		say:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Life is real, life is earnest,</p>
				<p class="i2">And the grave is not its goal;</p>
				<p>&#8216;Dust thou art, to dust returnest,&#8217;</p>
				<p class="i2">Was not written of the soul.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Consequently, if life <em>is</em> real and earnest, and the soul is incapable of mortality, things <em>must
		be</em> what they seem, and the soul <em>cannot</em> be dead that slumbers. And if the soul <em>is</em> dead
		that slumbers, and things are <em>not</em> really what they seem to be, life <em>is</em> indeed an empty
		dream.&#8217; <span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span> looked puzzled at this.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;You are somewhat hypercritical. Great thoughts must not be trimmed
		to the exact dialect of business-men. <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> reveals important truths; he utters
		what is pent within him from the impulse of utterance: he tells us that &#8216;Art is long and
		Time is fleeting;&#8217; now some arts are not long, and time often drags heavily. It will not
		do to be too precise in poetry.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But is that sentiment original? Does not one of the ancients say, &#8216;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ars longa, vita brevis</em>?&#8217;
		and does not that come pretty near to <span class="special_name">Longfellow&#8217;s</span> idea?&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Seatsfield</span>: &#8216;Yes, Sir, but that is a little criticism which picks out words. <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>,
		or yourself, or any other man, would have arrived at the same conclusion, even had
		the ancient author never written it.&#8217;</p>

		<p class="post_break_small">&#8216;We were here interrupted by a call to luncheon; and I take advantage of the break
		in my journal, to bring this article to a close. More of the <span class="special_name">Seatsfieldiana</span> I reserve for
		another number, provided the public are not already glutted.&#8217;</p>

	</div>

	<div class="ed_table_item">
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page589" title="589">&nbsp;</a><span class="ed_table_title">Magazine Writing</span>.&#8212;We know not how we can better evince our appreciation of the
		kind and flattering comments of a Southern correspondent, who will at once recognize our
		allusion, than by citing the somewhat kindred remarks of an old and favorite contributor,
		now passed away from earth. It was a pleasing matter, he said, to sit down with the proper
		afflatus stirring within him, to write an article for a Magazine. &#8216;If the work has a
		general prevalence; if its fame is rife on good men&#8217;s tongues, the inspiration is the stronger.
		One says to himself, how many friends of mine will overlook these very lucubrations, perceive
		my initials, and recognize my name? How many pleasing associations will thus be
		awakened, and peradventure commendatory remarks expressed, concerning my powers?
		What a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</em> for wakeful nights, emendations of phrases, the choosing of words,
		and toilsome revision! The other day,&#8217; he continues, &#8216;while reading the proof-sheet of my
		article in the last <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, I fell into a train of reflection upon the large amount
		of care and labor which must be entailed upon the publisher and editor of an original Magazine.
		Some one has observed, that when we listen to an exquisite opera, or any elaborate
		and intricate piece of music, we think not how vast were the pains and attention bestowed
		upon every note and cadence; what efforts for perfection in a solo, what panting for a warble,
		what travail for a trill! Taken separately, and at rehearsals, in disjointed fragments
		of sound, how different are they from that volume of sweet concords which is produced
		when they are all breathed forth in order, to the accompaniment of flutes and recorders, in
		one full gush of melody! This is just like a Magazine. How many minds does it engage!
		Cherished thoughts and cherished feelings, polished or sublimated, there find utterance, and
		demand that honor and deference to which they are entitled. In his beautiful Introduction
		to the Harleian Miscellany, <span class="special_name">Johnson</span> sets forth the necessity and benefit of similar
		writings, with reasons as conclusive as the language in which they are expressed is
		chaste and strong. In a country like ours, where the vast population move by common
		impulse; think promptly, are enlightened with ease, and turn to the best account that
		knowledge which is received with the greatest facility; are inspired with sacred and patriotic
		feelings from the bar, the senate, the pulpit, and the press; it is important and just
		that the readiest methods and means of instructive moral amusement should be the most
		esteemed and the best supported. I confess I never look into a Magazine, that I do not
		liken it to a large and pure reservoir of refreshing waters; derived from many streams,
		and prankt around its borders with the flowers and garniture of poesy; possessing qualities
		agreeable to every taste&#8212;the grave, the solid, the scientific, the light, the gay. It is a
		map of the higher moods of life. It conveys a sustenance with the relish of pleasure. All
		who favor it with their productions have different tastes and faculties of mind. Each one
		endeavors to do the best with his theme. He ornaments it in diction, or tasks his fancy,
		or explores the secrets of science, or illustrates the events and scenes of his country: he
		excites broad-mouthed laughter, by salutary jest and pun; he expatiates in pathetic sentences,
		or murmurs in the mellow cadence of song; or arouses interest by the embellishments
		wherewith history is refined, and which shed a light over the dim annals of the past,
		making them to smile,</p>


		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;even as the radiant glow,</p>
				<p>Kindling rich woods, whereon the etherial bow</p>
				<p>Sleeps lovingly awhile.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>&#8216;Now what I thought beside, while looking over my proof, was this: that a &#8216;circulating
		medium,&#8217; through which so many minds communicated their thoughts, produced and
		clothed with befitting language in solitary labor; smoothed, strengthened, or harmonized by
		revision, and rendered impressive by those helps and researches of which every <em>readable</em>
		writer must avail himself; such a medium, I say, merits the esteem and respect of all. It
		deserves not to be taken up for judgment, at a momentary glance, by the undiscerning
		eye of careless inquiry. It should be read impartially, and spoken of, in all worthy points,
		with praise; in faulty ones, with tenderness. Our literature, I take it, is not yet a sufficiently
		<a class="pagenum" id="page590" title="590">&nbsp;</a>flowery pursuit, to enable any of its votaries to sow its walks with brambles. By
		its influence, <em>the country</em> is to be mentally illustrated; the clanking shackles of transatlantic
		humbug are to be thrown off; and the establishment of wholesome feelings, and reliance
		upon our own intellectual resources, firmly effected. I love to see the general press engaged
		now and then in cheering onward the laborers in the more unfrequented and toilsome
		avenues of our literary vineyard. It sends a <span class="special_name">God</span>-speed to the bosoms of those whose travails
		are more for their country than themselves; and who are content, in anonymous
		pride, to believe, that it heralds that bright day of mental refinement which will ere long,
		among the freest and noblest confederacy of nations on earth, irradiate the utmost borders
		of that holy circumference,</p>

		<p class="centered_line">&#8216;Our Native Land!&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="ed_table_title">A thrust with a two-edged Weapon</span>.&#8212;We rather incline to the opinion that the

		that are not the less to be guarded against, certainly, when as in the present case they cut
		both ways. But our readers shall judge: <span class="special_name">Dear Editor</span>: The country, strange as it may
		appear, has peculiar and permanent inhabitants; neither dressing in skins, nor wearing

		beings can compose in perfection: &#8216;Hope <span class="special_name">John</span> is well, and <span class="special_name">Betsey</span> will come and see us
		next summer; and want&#8217;&#8212;<span class="special_name">Lawson</span> and <span class="special_name">Stewart</span>! what do they <em>not</em> want? Every
		thing; from twenty yards of silk down to a penny&#8217;s-worth of tape. The letters run somewhat
		in this guise, though less poetically:</p>

		<p>Half the things that are sent for, they might buy at their own doors. Again and again we
		have known them put in commission and procure from an oppressed relative the identical
		productions of a manufactory within a mile of them. A singular virtue seems to abide in
		all that comes from the sunny side of Broadway.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You perhaps may not know what an <span class="special_emphasis">Opportunity</span> is. In love affairs you have undoubtedly
		experienced that it is every thing; but in rural affairs it is more. It is the common-carrier
		of a village. So soon as an inhabitant has expressed his intention of going to town,
		he becomes an Opportunity, and like a Chinese, liable to pains and penalties for leaving
		his native place. From every quarter pour in letters, bundles, and packages, which are to
		be carried with care and delivered with despatch. No thanks for his trouble, if they should
		reach their destination, and a general liability for the uncertain value of their contents if
		they should chance to be lost. So that an Opportunity&#8217;s advent in town ought to be announced
		in this way: &#8216;Arrived, <span class="special_name">Hiram Doolittle</span>, from Connecticut, with m&#8217;dze to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page591" title="591">&nbsp;</a><span class="special_name">Legion and Company</span>.&#8217; The Opportunity not only transports, but acts as General Agent.
		Commissions are given him for a return freight. Hats, coats, dresses, are much wanted,
		which he is expected to select with taste, and to purchase cheap. Even the labyrinth of
		houses does not protect him from the Argus eyes of his consignees. They seek him out and
		insist upon his turning himself into a United States&#8217; mail and a <span class="special_name">Harnden&#8217;s</span> express. It is
		not a week since we heard a consignee&#8217;s friend&#8217;s friend request an Opportunity to carry
		home a loaf of sugar to his country correspondent.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Perhaps, Friend <span class="special_name">Knick.</span>, we are wounding your feelings all this time, tender by reason
		of many cousins and commissions; but we can assure you that we have an infinite respect
		for all relationship, and are rather blessed than bored by the requisitions of our own rural
		branches. We trust, however, that your rustic kith and kin do not come upon your house
		in the spring, in shoals like the shad. Unhappy editor, if it be so; for until the day predicted
		by <span class="special_name">Alphonse Karr</span>, when connexions shall be cooked and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c√¥telettes d&#8217;oncle √† la B√©chamel</em>
		and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">t√™tes de cousin en tortue</em> shall smoke lovingly upon the table, there is nothing for
		you but to submit to your Fates, or to give up your house-keeping. But with country cozens,
		those provincials who are not bone of your bone, and who nevertheless at every visit to
		town call upon you with an eager look and covetous smile, as if to say, &#8216;Ask us to dinner,
		we once invited you to tea,&#8217; there is but one method to pursue; the cut&#8212;the firm, unwavering,
		direct cut. Do not pretend not to see them, or to look fixedly in another direction,
		but give them the vacant, absent stare, as if you saw around them, and through them, and
		the image before you excited neither attention nor recollection. There are no terms to be
		kept with them. Their Shibboleth is not yours.</p>

		<p>&#8216;In the &#8216;Absentee,&#8217; a London fashionable lady, Mrs. <span class="special_name">Dazeville</span>, goes to Ireland, and is
		hospitably received by Lady <span class="special_name">Clonbrony</span>, stays a month at her country-house, and is as
		intimate with Lady <span class="special_name">Clonbrony</span> and her niece Miss <span class="special_name">Nugent</span>, as possible; and yet when
		Lady <span class="special_name">Clonbrony</span> comes to London, never takes the least notice of her. At length, meeting
		at the house of a common friend, Mrs. <span class="special_name">Dazeville</span> cannot avoid recognizing her, but
		does it in the least civil manner possible: &#8216;Ah, Lady <span class="special_name">Clonbrony</span>! Did not know you
		were in England! How long shall you stay in town? Hope before you leave England
		you will give us a day.&#8217; Lady <span class="special_name">Clonbrony</span> is so astonished at this ingratitude, that she
		remains silent; but Miss <span class="special_name">Nugent</span> answers quite coolly, and with a smile: &#8216;A day? certainly,
		to you who gave us a month.&#8217; Miss <span class="special_name">Edgeworth</span> evidently considers this a capital
		story; and we have no doubt that many stupid people who have read it consider it an
		excellent hit; but we can assure them that they know nothing of the woods and fields. It
		is a great favor to make people in the country a visit. It relieves them from the tiresome
		monotony of their rose-bushes and chickens; and by the active exertions in planning
		breakfasts and dinners, and making the one ride through the valley last for three afternoons,
		infuses if possible a certain degree of mental activity into their lives, which must
		be far from disagreeable to them. A cit too is in a certain degree a lion. The oldest town-jokes
		are as new in the country as last year&#8217;s ribbons; and the neighbors gather together
		to view with delight a face that they have not seen every Sunday for the last fifty-two
		weeks, and are only too happy to engage the Novelty at a &#8216;Tea.&#8217; But when they come
		to town, what can you do with them? Who the devil wants to see them? Your friends
		care little enough for you, still less for your agricultural acquaintances. You cannot bring
		yourself to go to <span class="special_name">Peale&#8217;s</span> Museum, or to see the talking-machine; and tickets at the opera
		are dear, unless you stand up.  As we said before, you must cut them, or</p>

		<p>you must try to have them arrested as soon as they arrive, as disturbers of domestic peace,
		and confined in the Tombs during the whole of their intended stay. If the Legislature sat in
		New-York instead of in a <em>country city</em>, they would pass some law similar to the South Carolina
		free-black law, confining all rural visitors, or at least making those liable to an indictment
		for false pretences, who claim acquaintance with the &#8216;people of the whirlpool.&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page592" title="592">&nbsp;</a>&#8216;If it were only for once, one might ask all his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rats des champs</em> to meet one another at a Tea.
		This might be amusing, if the jest did not grow painful by repetition. There is no reciprocity
		in your dealings with such invitees. You will probably never again reach their Siberian
		settlement, whereas they come to town three times a year! It is not fair. It is a
		base cheat. How can they be so ungenerous and illiberal as to accuse you of neglect and
		ingratitude for not cultivating them when in the city? They might as well abuse you for
		not having a green-house! This doctrine of ours is so clearly reasonable, that all people
		of any breeding admit its truth, and act accordingly. You may stay a week at a country-seat,
		and need make no acknowledgments of any kind to the owner thereof in his town-house;
		whereas a dinner in the city is a debt of honor, which must be paid. This is a
		well settled law. Not that your obligation is by any means cancelled. It is not dead, but
		dormant. Next summer you will feel deep gratitude for the kindness you received during
		the last; but no such indebtedness is payable in urbanity. <span class="special_name">George Selwyn</span> met in St.
		James-street, London, a man whom he had known very well in Bath, and passed steadily by
		him without a look of recognition. His acquaintance followed him, and said: &#8216;Sir, you
		knew me very well in Bath.&#8217; &#8216;Well, Sir,&#8217; replied <span class="special_name">Selwyn</span>, &#8216;in Bath I may possibly know

		<p><span class="ed_table_title">Another &#8216;pellet&#8217; from Julian.</span>&#8212;Not a word is necessary by way of introduction
		to the ensuing passages from an epistle lately received from our esteemed friend and correspondent
		<span class="special_name">Julian</span>. Happy husband of a happy wife and happier mother! Happy father!
		may his joy never be less: &#8216;We are in the country! When you write this way, say &#8216;To
		the care of &#8212;&#8212; &#8212;&#8212;, Esq.&#8217;, for we are designedly three miles from post-offices and newsboys.
		I have given warning that if any of the latter come within my grounds with his
		French things, I will souse him in the river, and hold him there till he shall be thoroughly
		chilled into a dislike of these parts. You will readily imagine why we are here. The
		excitements and distractions of city life for the last few months were too much for us, and
		there are some things that can only be enjoyed apart from the world. Here, we subside
		gradually and gracefully from that high and tense delirium from which I at least made
		my a√´rials, always coming back, however, to young <span class="special_name">Julian</span>; who, by the way, is another
		occasion for country life, as I have great faith in first impressions, and I wish his to be
		bright and beautiful. Heaven preserve him from all darker colors; from the doubts, the
		glooms, the moral mistiness of your city atmosphere! Let no fog come between him and
		the bright sky, till he has well discovered that there is a heaven beyond, where there is
		neither cloud nor shadow, and up to which not one grain of all this dust and filth of the
		earth&#8217;s whirling shall ever reach. It is quite enough that we are in sight and hearing of
		your great Babels; the jarring of their daily strife and the smoke of their torments. A
		lively and dashing river rolls between us, going off at a hand-gallop among rocky islands,
		over which we see their spires pointing up like electric-rods to avert the wrath that might
		otherwise descend upon them; and mingling with the dash of waters, we hear now and
		then their petty alarms, their steamers and fire-bells, and the dozen other occasions upon
		which they see fit to make a great noise in the world; but the travelled sound has a courtliness
		that is rather pleasant than otherwise; and as a key-note to our mocking-birds, it is
		quite worthy of the sweet south that brings it up. Whenever there is any sudden ebullition
		that cannot be pared down to the common air, we are made aware of it by a cannonading
		that is doubtless very considerable down there, but for any thing so ambitiously meant, it
		sounds here very miserable; a wretched attempt at notoriety, of which the most noticeable
		is the smoke of their powder. And so with all their sky-flourishing and rocketing, which
		we look at as at a falling star; pretty, no doubt, but not in our way. Every morning a railroad
		train starts out, and approaching within a mile, disappears among the hills with a slight
		buzzing and squibbing, like the fly on the window; and then after it has gone, as we suppose,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page593" title="593">&nbsp;</a>there is another squib, very smart and snappish, and we hear nothing more of it till
		the train comes down, frets a little again as it passes by, and goes on to discharge its contents
		in the great city. To all these things we say, &#8216;Pass on!&#8217; the world is various, and
		must be amused; but for us, we respectfully withdraw. We have had enough of the intense;
		we now welcome the trifling, appropriating however as much of the serious as we
		care to admit in our still life. When the Sabbath comes round, there are seven bells that
		reach us, each with its separate voice; and these, with falling waters, and the morning
		incense going up from the hill-sides, are as much of &#8216;mass&#8217; as we care to have in our
		worship. But we have a ready ear for all sweet sounds, and need no glasses to appreciate
		the beautiful. Sunrise and sunset; the grouping of clouds; the blue haze that now and
		then lies on the landscape, all one with my cigar-smoke; and the storms and lightnings of
		the young summer, so spitefully beautiful; all these, with whatever of glory there may be
		in the still watches of the night, find their place in our picture-gallery; but we leave them
		as <span class="special_name">God</span> made them, and add no tint to their coloring.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You are aware that the sun rises as per almanac. This is common; and so common,
		so much an every-day affair, that he gets very little credit therefor; and yet, that he will
		rise with great exactness, aside from all human calculation, and go on traversing the sky
		with a wonderful regularity that nothing can stop, is a very pleasant fact touching the prospect
		of to-morrow; and so also, that every thing in nature will be wrought with marvellous
		beauty and harmonies of sound; and oh! most satisfactory of all, there will still be
		an air that properly inhaled fills the <em>heart</em> as well as the lungs. It is from a calm consideration
		of this fact, that we have done with the <em>eagerness</em> of pleasure. No daily counting of
		hours to see that all have been properly brimmed; no grasping at a dozen things at once;
		no draining of the very dregs, lest that may be the last bottle, and we die to-morrow. But
		thankful as we are for to-morrow, and especially grateful for to-day, we don&#8217;t care for
		noon-marks. We have kept no count lately, and for aught we know, Time may have
		stopped, but probably not. He is doubtless somewhere about, but we take no particular
		notice. Our watches have run down, and we care not to wind them again. The hours,
		if there are any, are all golden, and we have no occasion to note the passage one to the
		other; or if we start them, just to see the motion, they run on diamonds of the purest water;
		but mostly, whether it be morn, or mid-day, or the starry night, Sabbath or week-day, it is
		all one&#8212;all beautiful. Does it rain? It is quite proper. The earth needs it, no doubt,
		and it will look the more grateful therefor. Does it shine? Why then the birds will sing,
		and if they will come a little nearer, we will teach them that charming air from the last
		opera. Does a new star come out in heaven, or an old one disappear? The one will be
		an added glory, and the other not much missed; but they will little concern our astronomy.
		Expect no more rhapsodies, my friend, unless it be upon the wonderful ease with which
		every thing can be done without them. That we find all things pleasant, is the extent of
		our poetry. It is pleasant to wake; it is pleasant to sleep; it is pleasant to wake and sleep
		again; pleasant to watch the opening lid, and pleasant the smile that follows it; pleasant
		are kind words and tones, the touch of hands, and the touch of lips; the breath of flowers
		and those that love them; pleasant are the thousand infinitesimals, like the motes of the
		sun-beam, not less bright because of their minuteness; and pleasant the thought that sufficient
		as this heaven may be, there is another one above. And doubtless it is pleasant to
		breathe as usual, and feel the heart send round its currents with a touch of joy; but oh,
		pleasanter than all, to have no sigh or throb, to remind you that that breath must one day
		stop, and that warm blood turn cold. Oh! in the &#8216;time&#8217; that is set apart &#8216;for all things,&#8217;
		may heaven look kindly on and count these trifling hours!</p>

		<p>&#8216;Shall we ever leave this charming retreat? Certainly not, while these things last; but
		it is not impossible that we may return with the cold weather. Meanwhile, I have made a
		chalk-mark about the grounds, and as yet nothing with a bite or sting has passed over it.
		Mrs. <span class="special_name">Julian</span>, as she now insists upon being called, has become highly contemplative; and
		if I did not know that she was never so happy before, I should think her sometimes a little
		<a class="pagenum" id="page594" title="594">&nbsp;</a>sad; she is so quiet, so demure, and so eternally bewitched with that boy! Why Sir, she
		will sit for half a day over the fellow, amusing herself and him with I know not what
		varieties and wonders of invention; with lullabies and ditties and hom≈ìopathies of language;
		and if he condescend to sleep for a few moments, how divinely still must every
		thing be! What infinite care is there in pinning the screen; what fortifications are built
		round about him; and what a world of protection in every movement! And then, when
		all is complete, she must still sit there, with that strange upward look which she has acquired
		lately, seeming to reach quite beyond the stars. She is a strange woman! Yesterday,
		having dined rather late, I happened to forget myself for a few moments on the lounge;
		and on waking, I found her kneeling before me, and looking up in my face with an expression
		that to me is peculiarly embarrassing; not the quick, joyous look, followed as quickly
		by the touch of lips; not that, but something quite indescribable. Perhaps I am not as
		considerate as I ought to be on such occasions, for doubtless she knows what she would be
		at, but I confess I do not. Indeed, she is constantly bringing out new points and flourishes,
		which to me are all vowels of the Hebrew; no doubt very sweet and musical, and certainly
		very necessary to the sense of the reading, but they are past all finding out. When
		she dazzles me with these brilliants, I sometimes reply in the Tartar, and so we are quits.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Young <span class="special_name">Julian</span> developes slowly. He has smiled once or twice, but in a manner so
		precocious, that it would be alarming, if he were at all delicate. Fortunately he is not.
		His utterance as yet is quite unintelligible, though no doubt he has his meaning. To Mrs.
		<span class="special_name">Julian</span> it is all poetry. &#8216;<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poeta nascitur</em>&#8217; may be quite true, but if he rhymes, which is
		quite possible to her ear, I am constrained to think that it is entirely accidental. I hope,
		at least, that he is not so viciously gifted. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Have</span> I told you that she refuses a nurse,
		and that too pretty sharply? Well, that is not all; I can hardly touch the boy myself.
		She is so afraid I shall crush it! My raptures, she says, are not becoming; she even says
		that I &#8216;frighten the child!&#8217; But she is the strangest of women! Last night, happening to
		wake some time in the small hours, I heard a slight noise in the room, and emerging from
		a dream, in which I remembered to have heard a good deal of crying and hushing, I listened
		intently for some moments, but couldn&#8217;t for my life guess what it could be. There
		was nothing moving in the room, and the sound appeared to arise from some slow and uniform
		movement, so that it couldn&#8217;t be the wind on the shutters; and if the mocking-birds
		had been sufficiently awake to swing, as they sometimes do, they would certainly have
		dropped a word or two, for they are great talkers. Now I often hear bells, fire-arms, and
		exclamations, and very often hear my name called, and questions asked, to which I reply
		in due form, all which I <em>know</em> at the time to be imaginary; but this sound, though it seemed
		to be familiar, I couldn&#8217;t make out. I was so drowsy, however, that I had half a mind
		to consider it a dream; but then what if any thing should happen? I should be responsible.
		Rising, therefore, very carefully, not to disturb Mrs. J., I discovered by the shaded light
		on the table that she was quite sound asleep; but what was wonderful, her right arm, outside
		the bed, was moving up and down with the regularity of a pendulum! What the
		deuce was all that? Well, Sir, I bent over breathlessly, and found she was pulling at a
		string! And what, O <span class="special_name">Editor</span>! who ought to know every thing, what do you think she
		was pulling? Why, Sir, she was pulling at young <span class="special_name">Julian&#8217;s</span> cradle. She was rocking the
		baby in her sleep! Oh!&#8217;</p>



		<p class="post_break_small"><span class="first_word">Apropos</span> of &#8216;the baby&#8217;: an agreeable correspondent, from whom we shall be happy to hear
		&#8216;frequently if not oftener,&#8217; intimates to us that our friend <span class="special_name">Julian</span>, when the &#8216;lactiferous
		animalcule&#8217; whose advent into this breathing world he lately described in such glowing
		terms, shall have reached a more mature babyhood, may find occasion to &#8216;change the paternal
		note;&#8217; and he cites for us the following passage, from an essay by a sometime contributor
		to the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, &#8216;in justification of his fears:&#8217;</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">In</span> my bachelor visitations to my married friends, I have often chuckled over the bashfulness,
			contending with love, which distinguishes the <span class="small_all_caps">YOUNG FATHER</span>. In the pride of his heart, perhaps,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page595" title="595">&nbsp;</a>when his little man has first given evidence of that degree of mental exertion called &#8216;taking notice,&#8217; he
			clasps the crowing baby in his arms; he rests its lily feet upon his knees; he endures with philosophic
			patience all the &#8216;gouging,&#8217; and pulling, and kicking, with which the young hero may testify his
			triumph; and while the young mother stands by, her eyes beaming with mingled love and pride, he
			becomes warmer in his romps; makes faces, as the nerveless fingers of the little one seek, with more
			earnestness, his eyes, or pull with a greater effort at his lips; and amid screams of laughter, he chases
			the flying hours, until at length a &#8216;pale cast of thought&#8217; flits over the baby&#8217;s face, like a cloud in a
			summer sky. This is the signal for immediate seriousness. The father grows grave&#8212;then frightened.
			He raises him gently from his lap, and with a single exclamation of &#8216;Take him mother!&#8217; consigns
			the precious charge to her arms, and darting a hasty glance at his &#8216;pants&#8217; he walks in silence
			from the room. Nor do we bachelors always escape with impunity. Anxious to win a smile from
			some fond mother, more than one of us may have dared to approach, with a kiss, the hallowed lips of
			her darling. But mark the quick wing of vengeance! Darting from its lurking place in the mouth,
			out flies the little doubled fist, and slams a well-beslabbered biscuit into the face of the intruder. He
			recoils, with his &#8216;reeking honors fresh upon him,&#8217; and the little squab coos in triumph at his failure.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="ed_table_title">National Academy of Design.</span>&#8212;The growing interest felt in relation to the Fine Arts
		in this country, and the influence which the <span class="special_name">National Academy of Design</span> has had in producing
		that interest, make it imperative upon us to notice the pictures which are annually
		sent to this exhibition. In passing through the Academy with this object in view, we have
		been at some loss to know where to begin. Finding however by chance at the end of
		the catalogue an alphabetical arrangement of the exhibitors&#8217; names, we have adopted this
		as the best method of laying the merits of the several pictures before our readers. We
		therefore begin with:</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">V. G. Audubon, A.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Audubon</span> exhibits four pictures this season: of these, No. 133,
		&#8216;Grove of Palm-trees&#8217; in the Island of Cuba, we prefer. This picture appears to be a
		faithful representation of the scene, and is handled with a free and firm pencil. The trees
		are perhaps a little too literally represented, to be agreeable to the eye, consisting as they
		do of so many equally straight and unpicturesque lines. No. 237, &#8216;Moon-light Squall
		coming up,&#8217; is a pleasing representation of one of Nature&#8217;s poetical moments. The light is
		clear and silvery, and the water transparent and truthful. The whole scene is interesting,
		and there is but little to find fault with; although perhaps parts would admit of more
		warmth of color.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">J. D. Blondell</span> has six pictures, the majority portraits. No. 80, &#8216;Portrait of a Lady,&#8217;
		half-length, is a pleasing picture; warm in color and carefully painted, and gives evidence
		of rising talent. The head is perhaps slightly deficient in careful drawing; but few artists
		are competent to paint a lady&#8217;s portrait; and this gentleman should not feel discouraged,
		though his work be found slightly deficient in that grace which is so difficult of attainment.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Boddington</span>, (London,) exhibits three landscapes, all in a style peculiarly belonging to
		the English school. They possess great charms; facility of execution, and delicacy of
		handling.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Bonfield.</span>&#8212;No. 168 is perhaps the best of his productions. If it were not for the pinky
		hue of the sky, this would indeed be a charming picture.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">F. Bayle.</span>&#8212;No. 25; &#8216;Picture-Dealer.&#8217; A deep-toned, carefully-painted picture, and
		evincing much promise in so young an artist. We are glad to perceive that it is purchased
		by the American Art-Union.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">G. L. Brown.</span>&#8212;No. 400; &#8216;View of the Tiber.&#8217; Too much of an imitation of old pictures.
		In seeking this quality, the artist has lost sight of the truth and freshness of nature.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Chapman, N. A.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Chapman</span> presents nine pictures this season, and all in his usual
		brilliant style. No. 116, &#8216;Peasant Girl of Albano,&#8217; is exceedingly rich in color, and forcible
		in effect: a few cool tints about the head-dress would give perhaps still greater value to
		the warm tones. No. 189, &#8216;Hebrew Women,&#8217; is this artist&#8217;s gem of the year. Well composed,
		pleasing in color, and carefully finished, it expresses the occurrence with fidelity
		and truth. No. 204, &#8216;Boy in Indian Costume,&#8217; is an attractive picture; but No. 213, &#8216;On
		the Fence,&#8217; is more to our liking. The story is well told; the city beau is carefully and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page596" title="596">&nbsp;</a>truly represented; and the dogs are admirable. No. 263, portrait of Doctor <span class="special_name">Anderson</span>,
		the father of wood-engraving in this country, is capital. No. 266, &#8216;Lazy Fisherman,&#8217; is
		Laziness personified. No. 341, &#8216;Sketch from Nature,&#8217; in water-colors, is an exemplification
		of this gentleman&#8217;s versatility of talent.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">J. G. Clonney, A.</span>, has two pictures in the exhibition, Nos. 7 and 160. No. 7, &#8216;The
		New-Year&#8217;s Call,&#8217; is decidedly the best. The negro is well painted. Mr. <span class="special_name">Clonney&#8217;s</span> works
		generally evince great observation of nature in this class of subjects.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">T. Cole, N. A.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Cole</span> exhibits but one picture, and that comparatively a small one.
		It possesses however many of the admirable characteristics of his works, particularly his
		early ones. It would be difficult to find a middle-ground and distance surpassing those of
		this picture.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">T. Crawford</span>, (Rome.)&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Crawford</span> gives us two full-length statues, in which the
		charm of the <em>marble</em> is strongly apparent. Mr. <span class="special_name">Crawford</span>, we grieve to say, is evidently
		too impatient in the finish of his works to produce that correctness which is essential to a
		high effort of art.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">J. F. Cropsey.</span>&#8212;No. 68, &#8216;View in Orange County,&#8217; is a careful representation of nature,
		and has the appearance to our eyes of having been painted on the spot; a practice very
		rarely to be found in young artists. A continuance in this course will place this artist in a
		prominent position as a landscape-painter. The sky is faulty in color, being too purple to
		meet our views of nature; and there is a lack of delicacy in the more receding portions
		of the work. But the fore-ground is carefully painted, and full of truth.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Cummings, N. A.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Cummings</span> has but one picture. It possesses however the careful
		finish, gentlemanly character, and general truthfulness, so characteristic of this fine artist.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">T. Cummings, Jr.</span>, a young artist. No. 149, &#8216;The Ball,&#8217; is his best work. In thus
		attempting a subject of great difficulty of execution, he evinces promise of future ability.
		The picture has many pleasing points, marked however with some errors, which time and
		practice, let us hope, will correct.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">C. Curtis.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Curtis</span> has two pictures in the exhibition, and both of merit. No. 196
		is among the best heads in the collection.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">J. W. Dodge, A.</span>&#8212;&#8216;Miniature Portraits.&#8217; Those of <span class="special_name">Henry Clay</span> and Gen. <span class="special_name">Jackson</span>
		are the most prominent. The likenesses are good, and the pictures carefully finished; a
		merit in works of this character frequently unattended to. There is, however, a want of
		dignity sometimes to be found in Mr. <span class="special_name">Dodge&#8217;s</span> portraits, which we could wish to see remedied:
		it would give an elevation to his paintings which they at present lack.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Paul P. Duggan.</span>&#8212;&#8216;John the Baptist&#8217; is a model in plaster, which displays greater
		knowledge of anatomy than we are in the habit of finding in the works of even older
		artists. In this respect it possesses great merit. We understand it is his first effort in
		modelling. As such, it is truly a work of the highest promise.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Durand, N. A.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Durand</span> has contributed largely to the present exhibition, in every
		sense of the word. His most prominent production is No. 36, &#8216;The Solitary Oak.&#8217; For an
		exhibition-picture, perhaps it is not so striking as some of his previous works; yet it will
		bear examination better. Without any effort at warmth of color, it has that glow of sunlight
		which it is so difficult to express. A veteran tree, standing alone upon a gentle eminence,
		stretching forth its giant arms, that have withstood the storms of centuries, is truly
		a noble subject for an artist of Mr. <span class="special_name">Durand&#8217;s</span> reputation; and most truly has he depicted
		it. The distance is beautiful, and the introduction of cattle seeking their evening shelter
		gives an interest seldom to be found in works of this class. Should we attempt to find a
		fault, it would be the want of a little more warmth and clearness in the dark parts of the
		fore-ground. No. 134, another charming landscape; true to nature, of a silvery tone, and
		most exquisite sweetness of color and delicacy of touch. Nos. 181 and 258 are two careful
		studies from nature, wherein special care has been given to the trunks of trees, a feature
		in landscape-painting upon which sufficient attention is rarely bestowed. No. 244, &#8216;Emigrant
		Family,&#8217; is full of interest. The travelling family are encamped under the shade of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page597" title="597">&nbsp;</a>the trees, and the kettle hung over the fire shows that they are evidently preparing to refresh
		themselves for farther toil and journeying. The foliage of the trees is elaborately
		executed; the distance is well preserved; and the whole possesses great truth to nature;
		perhaps however, like all &#8216;<em>green</em>&#8217; pictures, it is less attractive in an exhibition than works
		of a warmer color. No. 163, &#8216;Portrait of a Gentleman,&#8217; has great force, and shows the
		artist&#8217;s versatility of genius.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">F. W. Edmonds, N. A.</span>&#8212;No. 105, &#8216;Beggar&#8217;s Petition,&#8217; is a spirited and faithful representation
		of the cold indifference to the wants of others, displayed in the miser&#8217;s disposition.
		The figures are of life-size, and well drawn. The female supplicating in behalf of the
		distressed, is graceful in attitude, and admirably contrasted with the hoarding miser.
		No. 205, &#8216;The Image Pedler,&#8217; is an effort of a higher order; for the artist has attempted,
		and successfully too, to elevate the class of works to which it belongs. In short, he has
		invested a humble subject with a moral dignity, which we hope our younger artists,
		who paint in this department, will not lose sight of. An independent farmer has his
		family around him, apparently immediately after dinner, and a strolling pedler appears
		among them, to dispose of his wares; and this gives interest to the whole group. The
		grandmother drops her peeling-knife, and the mother takes her infant from the cradle,
		to gaze at the sights in the pedler&#8217;s basket. The husband, who has been reading in
		the cool breeze of the window, turns to participate in the sport; while the grandfather
		takes a bust of <span class="special_name">Washington</span>, places it on the table, and commences an earnest
		elucidation of the character of the, &#8216;Father of his Country&#8217; to the little children around
		him. All the figures are intelligent, and the whole scene conveys to the mind a <em>happy
		family</em>. In color, light and shade, and composition, it is masterly; and we see in it that
		minuteness of detail and careful finish are not incompatible with a broad and luminous
		effect.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">C. L. Elliott</span> has five portraits in the exhibition. His &#8216;Full-length of <span class="special_name">Gov. Seward</span>&#8217;
		is a prominent one, although not his most agreeable picture. No. 61 is we think the best,
		and is a well-managed portrait, both in drawing and color.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">G. W. Flagg, H.</span>&#8212;No. 63, &#8216;Half-length of a Lady,&#8217; has considerable merit. It is rich and
		mellow in color, and better we think than many of Mr. <span class="special_name">Flagg&#8217;s</span> recent works. No. 208,
		&#8216;The Widow,&#8217; is a popular picture; pleasing in expression, and possessing more refinement
		of character than is observable in many of his other portraits. No. 102, &#8216;Bianca Visconti,&#8217;
		we do not admire.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">G. Freeman.</span>&#8212;Miniature portraits, generally large, and highly finished. This gentleman
		has lately arrived from Europe, and is we believe a popular artist; yet we do not like
		his productions.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">J. Frothingham, N. A.</span>&#8212;Nos. 32 and 35: portraits exhibiting Mr. <span class="special_name">Frothingham&#8217;s</span>
		usual bold and free style in this department of art; remarkably fine likenesses; true in color,
		and of pleasing general effect.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">H. P. Gray, N. A.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Gray</span> exhibits a number of his works this season. He seems
		to us to sacrifice every thing to color; and his color is not such as is generally seen in nature,
		but rather what he has seen in pictures. This we think a mistake, and one which
		we must be permitted to hope he will rectify. In the pictures which he formerly painted, a
		much closer attention to nature is observable. Mr. <span class="special_name">Gray</span> has all the feeling of an artist,
		with no ordinary talent; and we regret to find that he wanders from the direct path. We
		were among the first, if not the very first, to call public attention to his merits, and it is
		with reluctance that we perform the duty involved in these animadversions. &#8216;Comparisons,&#8217;
		<span class="special_name">Dogberry</span> tells us, &#8216;are odorous;&#8217; we cannot help remarking, however, that Mr. <span class="special_name">Gray&#8217;s</span>
		old fellow-student, <span class="special_name">Huntington</span>, is (<em>longa intervallo</em>) in the advance. We prefer, of our
		artist&#8217;s present efforts, the picture of &#8216;His Wife.&#8217; It has a pleasing effect, and is more finished
		than usual, and more natural in tone than his &#8216;Magdalen.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">J. T. Harris, A.</span>, has two pictures, and both portraits. No. 19 is the best. It exhibits
		<a class="pagenum" id="page598" title="598">&nbsp;</a>a broad, free touch, and correct drawing, and is withal an excellent likeness. But we
		never look at Mr. <span class="special_name">Harris&#8217;</span> works without being impressed with the idea that they are not
		finished. They seem to us, to borrow an artistical expression, as if they were in a capital
		state for &#8216;glazing and toning up.&#8217; Otherwise, they are above the ordinary run of portraits.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">G. P. A. Healy, H.</span>&#8212;Mr. <span class="special_name">Healy</span> is a resident of Paris, but an American. He is a
		favorite at the French court, and has by this means a reputation to which his works generally
		do not entitle him. We are bound in justice to say of his present effort, however, that
		it is an exceedingly fine picture. It is boldly and masterly executed; forcibly drawn, honestly
		colored, and well expressed. There is too about it a freedom from all the usual tricks
		of the profession, such as a red chair, velvet collar, and fantastic back-ground, which we
		particularly recommend to the attention of young artists.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Thomas Hicks, A.</span>, has eight pictures in the collection, but none, excepting his portraits,
		which equal his former productions. No. 264, &#8216;The Mother&#8217;s Grave,&#8217; is an oft-repeated
		subject, and should not be attempted unless the artist is able to treat it with entire originality.
		There are good points about it, but none sufficiently attractive to warrant particular
		notice.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Ingham, N. A.</span>, as usual has a fine collection of female portraits, all excellent for their
		careful drawing, lady-like expression, and high finish. The drapery and accessories of
		Mr. <span class="special_name">Ingham&#8217;s</span> portraits are always wonderfully exact to nature; and this greatly enhances
		the value of portraits of this description; for aside from their merit as likenesses, they will
		always be valuable as pictures. His male portrait, No. 113, of <span class="special_name">T. S. Cummings</span>, Esq., is
		a most admirable likeness, as well as a highly-wrought and masterly-painted picture. No.
		239, &#8216;Portrait of a Lady,&#8217; with a fan in her hand, is our favorite among his female heads.
		There is a sweetness and modesty in the expression, not only in the countenance but in the
		whole figure, which makes it peculiarly attractive.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">H. Inman, N. A.</span>&#8212;No. 62, &#8216;Portrait of the late Bishop <span class="special_name">Moore</span>, of Virginia,&#8217; is the admiration
		of all who behold it. In color it surpasses any thing of Mr. <span class="special_name">Inman&#8217;s</span> we have seen
		in many a day. Clear and luminous, with great breadth of light, and a mild, pleasing expression.
		We of course mean this to apply to the head. The hand and part of the drapery
		are not, in our judgment, so well done. No. 104, &#8216;Lady with a Mask,&#8217; we do not altogether
		like; yet it is remarkable for being foreshortened in every part, and possesses that singular
		charm of light and shadow, and accidental effect, which are the characteristics of our artist&#8217;s
		pencil. No. 314, a Landscape, although small, is delicately handled, and &#8216;touched
		in&#8217; with great neatness and accuracy. In effect it is attractive, and in color pleasing. The
		figure in the fore-ground equals in care and minuteness of finish the manner of <span class="special_name">Wouvermans</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">N. Jocelyn.</span>&#8212;No. 57, &#8216;Portrait of Professor <span class="special_name">Silliman</span>,&#8217; a faithful likeness, and carefully-painted
		portrait of a distinguished individual. No. 2, &#8216;Portrait of a Child,&#8217; is another
		finished picture by this artist; clear and pearly in color and infantile in expression.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Alfred Jones.</span>&#8212;No. 301, an engraving from <span class="special_name">Mount&#8217;s</span> picture of &#8216;Nooning,&#8217; for the
		American Art-Union, is one of the largest line-engravings ever published in this country,
		and a work of high order. This style of engraving has heretofore received so little encouragement,
		that until the Art-Union started it, no one except Mr. <span class="special_name">Durand</span> had ever before
		dared to attempt it. This effort of Mr. <span class="special_name">Jones</span> does him great credit.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">M. Livingstone, A.</span>, has several works in the exhibition, but we cannot rank them
		among the higher class of landscapes. They lack the poetry of landscape-painting; but
		as amateur productions, they are very good.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">E. D. Marchant, A.</span>&#8212;All portraits, but none of high merit. Mr. <span class="special_name">Marchant</span> is a persevering
		artist, who paints good likenesses and pleasing pictures; and so far, is doubtless
		popular with those who employ him.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">John Megarey</span> has two portraits, and those far surpassing his former works. They are
		carefully painted, without an effort at any thing beyond the subject before the artist.</p>

		<p>We shall resume and conclude our remarks upon the exhibition in our next number.</p>

		<div class="gossip_section">
			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page599" title="599">&nbsp;</a><span class="ed_table_title">Gossip with Readers and Correspondents.</span>&#8212;We are about to enter upon the
			<span class="small_all_caps">TWENTY-FOURTH</span> volume of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, for the advertisement of which, please
			note the second and third pages of the cover of the present number. We have nothing
			farther to add, than that &#8216;what <em>has been</em>, is that which <em>shall be</em>,&#8217; in our onward progress.
			This Magazine, much the oldest in the United States, has been established, by the ever-unabated
			favor of the public, upon a basis of unshaken permanence. Its subscription-list
			fluctuates only in advance; it has the <em>affection</em> of its readers, and all concerned in its production
			and promulgation, to a degree wholly unexampled; and it is designed not only to
			maintain, but continually to enhance, its just claims upon the liberal patronage of American
			readers. The arrangements for the next volume, if they do not &#8216;preclude competition,&#8217; will
			be found, it is confidently believed, to preclude any thing like successful rivalry, on the part
			of any of our contemporaries. On this point, however, we choose as heretofore to be
			judged by the public. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> gave in a recent issue two or three extracts from a lecture
			on &#8216;<cite>The Inner Life of Man</cite>&#8217; delivered by Mr. <span class="special_name">Charles Hoover</span>, at Newark, New-Jersey.
			This admirable performance has since been repeated to a highly gratified audience
			in this city; and from it we derive the following beautiful passage, which we commend to
			the heart of every lover of his kind: &#8216;It is a maxim of patriotism never to despair of the
			republic. Let it be the motto of our philanthropy never to despair of our sinning, sorrowing
			brother, till his last lingering look upon life has been taken, and all avenues by which angels
			approach the stricken heart are closed and silent forever. And in such a crisis, let no
			counsel be taken of narrow, niggard sentiment. When in a sea-storm some human being
			is seen in the distant surf, clinging to a plank, that is sometimes driven nearer to the shore,
			and sometimes carried farther off; sometimes buried in the surge, and then rising again, as
			if itself struggling like the almost hopeless sufferer it supports, who looks sadly to the shore
			as he rises from every wave, and battling with the billow, mingles his cry for help with the
			wild, mournful scream of the sea-bird; nature in every bosom on the shore is instinct with
			anxious pity for his fate, and darts her sympathies to him over the laboring waters. The
			child drops his play-things, and old age grasps its crutch and hurries to the spot; and the
			hand that cannot fling a rope is lifted to heaven for help. What though the sufferer be a
			stranger, a foreigner, an enemy even? Nature in trouble, in consternation, shrieks &#8216;<em>He is
			a man!</em>&#8217; and every heart and hand is prompt to the rescue.&#8217; &#8216;To a high office and ministry,
			to a life of beneficence, pity and love, each man should deem himself called by a divine
			vocation, by the appointment of nature; and otherwise living, should judge himself
			to be an abortion, a mistake, without signification or use in a world like ours. And the
			beauty, the glory of such a life, is not to be reckoned among ideal things heard out of heaven
			but never encountered by the eye. This world has had its <span class="special_name">Christ</span>, its <span class="special_name">Fenelons</span>, its
			<span class="special_name">Howards</span>, as well as its <span class="special_name">Caligulas</span> and <span class="special_name">Neros</span>. Love hath been at times a manifestation
			as well as a principle; and the train of its glory swept far below the stars, and its brightness
			has fallen in mitigated and mellowed rays from the faces of men. As the ambiguous
			stranger-star of Bethlehem had its interpreting angel-song to the herdsmen of the plains, so
			loving men in all ages have given glimpses and interpretations of the love of <span class="special_name">God</span>, and of
			the pity that is felt for the miserable and the guilty in the palace and presence-chamber of
			<span class="special_name">Jehovah</span>. What glory within the scope of human imitation and attainment is comparable to
			that of the beneficent, the sympathising lover of his race? What more elevated, pure, and
			beautiful is possible among the achievements of an endless progression in heaven itself?
			<span class="special_name">Milton</span> represents the profoundest emotions of joy and wonder among the celestial hosts
			as occasioned by the first anticipative disclosures of divine pity toward sinning man; and
			a greater than <span class="special_name">Milton</span> assures us that the transport and festival of angelic joy occurs when
			Pity lifts the penitent from his prostration and forgives his folly.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Embellishment</span>
			would seem to be the literary order of the day, in more ways than one. It has come to be
			the mode to express the most simple thought in the most magniloquent phrase. This propensity
			<a class="pagenum" id="page600" title="600">&nbsp;</a>to lingual <em>Euphuism</em> has given rise to sundry illustrations, in embellished maxims,
			which are particularly amusing. They are of the sort so finely satirized by &#8216;<span class="special_name">Ollapod</span>,&#8217; on
			one occasion, two or three examples of which we annex. The common phrase of &#8216;&#8217;Tis
			an ill wind that blows nobody any good&#8217; was transformed into &#8216;That gale is truly diseased
			which puffeth benefactions to nonentity;&#8217; &#8216;Let well enough alone,&#8217; into &#8216;Suffer a healthy
			sufficiency to remain in solitude;&#8217; and &#8216;What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,&#8217;
			into &#8216;The culinary adornments which suffice for the female of the race <em>Anser</em>,
			maybe relished also with the masculine adult of the same species.&#8217; Some London wag,
			in a kindred spirit, has illustrated the cockney song, &#8216;If I had a donkey as vouldn&#8217;t go,
			do you think I&#8217;d wallop him?&#8217; etc., as follows: &#8216;The herbaceous boon and the bland recommendation
			to advance, are more operative on the ansinine quadruped than the stern
			imprecation and the oaken cudgel:</p>

			<p><span class="first_word">Our</span> Pine-street correspondent, who addresses us upon the &#8216;<em>Fashionable Society in New-York</em>,&#8217;
			writes from the promptings of an honest-hearted frankness, <em>that</em> is quite clear; but
			he has not yet acquired that sort of useful information which is conveyed by the term,
			&#8216;knowing the world.&#8217; The &#8216;fashionable circles&#8217; <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</em>, whose breeding and bearing
			he impugns, are of the <span class="special_name">Beauvoir</span> school; persons who &#8216;are of your <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gens de cotorie</em>;
			your people of the real &#8216;caste&#8217; and &#8216;tone;&#8217; that is, your people who singly would be set
			down as nought in society, but who, as a &#8216;set,&#8217; have managed to make their joint-stock impudence
			imposing.&#8217; Our correspondent, we suspect, has one important lesson to learn in
			his intercourse with such persons; and it is a lesson which has been felicitously set forth
			by a late English essayist. There is a recipe in some old book, he says, &#8216;How to avoid
			<a class="pagenum" id="page603" title="603">&nbsp;</a>being tossed by a bull;&#8217; and the instruction is, &#8216;<em>Toss him.</em>&#8217; Try the experiment upon the
			first coxcomb who fancies that you are his inferior; charge first, and give him to understand
			at once that he is yours. Be coldly supercilious with all &#8216;important&#8217; catiffs, and most
			punctual be your attention to any matter in debate; but let no temptation prevail with you
			to touch on any earthly point beyond it. In the case alluded to, a pompous old baronet
			comes down stairs loaded to the very muzzle to repress &#8216;familiarity&#8217; on the part of a young
			man, who from an estate of dependence has recently mounted by inheritance to a princely
			fortune; but the cool, quiet young gentleman finds the old baronet guilty of &#8216;familiarity&#8217;
			himself, and makes him bear the penalty of it, before six sentences are exchanged between
			them. The secret of the whole thing was, a quiet look directly in the eye, and the preservation
			of a deliberate silence; the true way to dissolve your pompous gentleman or affected
			&#8216;fashionable&#8217; lady. The baronet&#8217;s long pauses the young heir did not move to interrupt.
			His mere <em>listening</em> drew the old aristocrat gradually out; his auditor replied monosyllabically,
			and made him pull him all the way. It was pitiful to see the old buzzard,
			who thought himself high and mighty, compelled to communicate with one who would
			have no notion of any body&#8217;s being high and mighty at all; getting gradually out of patience
			at the obstinate formality he was compelled to encounter, which he was sure any
			direct overture toward intimacy on his part would remove; and at last, in the midst of his
			doubts whether he should be familiar with the young man, being struck with a stronger
			doubt whether such familiarity would be reciprocated; it was a rich scene altogether, and
			worthy of being remembered by our correspondent. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> May issue of the &#8216;<cite>Cultivator</cite>&#8217;
			agricultural Magazine, which under the supervision of the late <span class="special_name">Willis Gaylord</span>
			reached a circulation of between forty and fifty thousand copies, contains an elaborate
			notice of its lamented editor, in which we find (in a letter from <span class="special_name">H. S. Randall</span>, Esq.,) the
			following passage:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">His</span> reading was literally boundless. He was as familiar with the natural sciences, history, poetry,
				and belles-letters, as with agriculture, and nearly if not quite as well qualified to discuss them. It
				was difficult to start any literary topic which you did not at once perceive had been examined by him
				with the eye of a scholar and critic. In one of my letters, half sportively, yet in a serious tone, I
				asked him &#8216;what he thought of the German Philosophy?&#8217; In his answer, <span class="special_name">Kant</span> and <span class="special_name">Fichte</span>, and I
				think <span class="special_name">Schelling</span> and <span class="special_name">Jacobi</span>, were discussed with as much familiarity as most scholars would find
				themselves qualified to make use of in speaking of <span class="special_name">Locke</span>, or <span class="special_name">Stewart</span>, or <span class="special_name">Brown</span>. In commenting
				on the report of mine, (on Common School Libraries,) alluded to by him in the last Cultivator, he
				betrays an extensive knowledge of the literature of nearly every nation in Europe. As a writer, the
				public have long been acquainted with Mr. <span class="special_name">Gaylord</span>. He wrote on nearly every class of topics connected
				with human improvement; in papers, magazines, and not unfrequently in books. But it is as
				an agricultural writer that he is best known. Here, taken all in all, he stands unrivalled. There are
				many agricultural writers in our country who are as well or better qualified to discuss a single topic,
				than he was. But I deem it not disrespectful to say, that for acquaintance with and ability to discuss
				clearly and correctly every department of agricultural science, he has not, he never has had, an
				equal in this State. He was every way fitted for an editor. Placable and forgiving in his temper;
				modest, disinterested, unprejudiced; never evincing a foolish credulity; above deception, despising
				quackery; with an honesty of motive that was never suspected.&#8217;</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>No one who knew intimately our lamented relative and friend, but will confirm the
			justice of this encomium. We trust that a collection of <span class="special_name">Willis Gaylord&#8217;s</span> writings, literary,
			scientific, and agricultural, will be made by some competent hand. They are demanded,
			we perceive, by various public journals throughout the country. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="special_name">Professor
			Gouraud&#8217;s</span> extraordinary exposition of <em>Phreno-Mnemotechny</em> seems to be winning him
			&#8216;fame and fortune&#8217; wherever he goes. He was in Philadelphia at the last advices, where
			his success was to the full as signal as in this city. It is obvious, we think, that the advantages
			of this great system will hereafter be chiefly enjoyed by the rising generation, who
			will thus be enabled to attain in six months an amount of information which in the ordinary
			way could scarcely be mastered in as many years. Still, the science has already
			been studied by hundreds of highly-endowed <em>men</em>, persons eminent in their own peculiar
			walks, who have cheerfully yielded their tributes of admiration to its vast resources.
			Several excellent articles upon this theme have from time to time appeared in the columns
			of the &#8216;New World&#8217; weekly journal, from the pen of Mr. <span class="special_name">Mackay</span>, one of the editors;
			who, being himself a pupil of Mr. <span class="special_name">Gouraud</span>, writes from personal experience of the matter
			<a class="pagenum" id="page604" title="604">&nbsp;</a>in question. &#8216;A thousand dollars,&#8217; he avers, &#8216;would not be a fair equivalent for the
			great advantages obtainable by Phreno-Mnemotechny;&#8217; and in this opinion there is a general
			concurrence of Professor <span class="special_name">Gouraud&#8217;s</span> pupils in this city. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">What</span> a power there

			some one supereminent article of food as a high ideal, to which all other kinds of edibles

			dish appears, the more vulgar and common-place it becomes: &#8216;They are low, uncommon
			low; reg&#8217;lar b&#8217;iled mutton and turnips. They may be rich, but they a&#8217;nt genteel. Nothink

			veals and parsley and butters&#8212;shocking wulgarity! And look at the father: I never see
			no gentleman with so broad a back, except p&#8217;raps a prize-ox.&#8217; There is another very amusing
			character in the same story; one of those stupid matter-of-fact persons, who can never
			appreciate a figure of speech, or understand the simplest jest. A &#8216;benign cerulean,&#8217; enthusiastic
			for the &#8216;rights of the sex,&#8217; remarks that woman&#8217;s rights and duties are becoming
			every day more widely appreciated. &#8216;The old-fashioned scale must be readjusted; and
			woman, noble, elevating, surprising woman, ascend to the loftiest eminence, and sit superior
			on the topmost branch of the social tree.&#8217; The ear of the matter-of-fact man catches
			the last simile, and he ventures to say: &#8216;Uncommon bad climbers, for the most part in
			general, is women. Their clothes isn&#8217;t adapted to it. I minds once I seen a woman climb
			a pole after a leg of mutting!&#8217; If looks could have killed the mal-apropos speaker, he
			would not have survived the reception which this ridiculous remark encountered from every
			guest at the table. He was himself struck with the mournful silence that followed his observation,
			and added, by way of explanation: &#8216;That was a thing as happing&#8217;d on a pole;
			in coors it would be werry different on a tree, because of the branches.&#8217; At length, however,
			the theme of woman is renewed by the former advocate: &#8216;Woman has not yet received
			her full development. The time will come when her influence shall be universal;
			when, softened, subdued, and elevated, the animal now called Man will be unknown.
			You will be all women: can the world look for a higher destiny?&#8217; &#8216;In coors,&#8217; observed
			the old spoon, &#8216;if we are all turned into woming, the world will come to an end. For
			&#8216;spose a case; &#8216;spose it had been my sister as married my wife, instead of me; it&#8217;s probable
			there would&#8217;nt have been no great fambly; wich in coors, if there was no population&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;
			What the fearful result of this supposed case would have been, was not permitted to transpire.
			The feminine &#8216;b&#8217;iled veals and parsley and butters&#8217; immediately rose and left the

			&#8216;I will, Sir.&#8217; &#8216;You <em>will</em>?&#8217; rejoined the Italian; &#8216;you <em>will</em>, eh? <span class="special_name">Goddam</span>, you <span class="small_all_caps">MUSHT</span>!&#8217; And
			this settled the question. But to the story &#8216;under notice,&#8217; which was picked up by our correspondent
			at Cairo, in Egypt:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>&#8216;An impetuous Englishman, unacquainted with any language but his own, was desirous of seeing
				Egypt, and satisfying himself by occular demonstration of the truth of the many wonders which he
				had heard of that celebrated land. To get to Alexandria was easy enough; and some acquaintances
				whom he had picked up on the way, kindly facilitated his journey to the Nile, and saw him fairly
				afloat in his <em>cangea</em> for Cairo. But here, left with an Arab captain, and five swarthy Egyptians, his
				difficulties commenced, and without knowing a single word of Arabic, he had to depend on his own
				resources. The boats on the Nile are very ticklish flat-bottomed affairs, wretchedly handled. Before
				the wind they rush up like steamers, but on a wind, go to lee-ward like feathers; while in consequence
				of the Nile being full of shifting sand-banks, with a daily varying depth of water, they are
				continually running aground in the middle of the river. To this add the laziness of the captain and
				<a class="pagenum" id="page606" title="606">&nbsp;</a>crew, to whom time was of no consequence; to-day, to-morrow, the next day, or a week hence, was all
				the same to them; they had no preferment to look forward to, no release from labor but death; and
				wisely enough, perhaps, exerted themselves as little as they could. &#8216;<em>Inshalla!</em> <span class="special_name">God</span> was great, and
				the sun was hot! Why should they weary themselves?&#8217; And so they took every opportunity to rest,
				cook their miserable fare, and dawdle the listless hours away. Of these dilatory habits of the natives
				the Englishman had been warned, and that whenever it happened, he was to prevent them from
				stopping, and force them to go on.</p>

				<p>&#8216;The opportunity was not long wanting. Without any reason sufficiently apparent to him, the huge
				stone fastened to a coir cable, and doing duty for an anchor, was dropped overboard, and the crew
				betook themselves to sleep. What was to be done? Of Arabic he had not a word to tell them to
				proceed; but he had plenty of English; so by dint of shaking his stick at the captain, and a somewhat
				boisterous &#8216;G-d d&#8212;n your eyes!&#8217; roared out in a tone sufficiently indicative of his wishes,
				the primitive &#8216;anchor&#8217; was got up, and onward they proceeded. Delighted to find his most British
				remonstrance succeed, he did not let it rust for want of practice; but every time the lazy crew attempted
				to &#8216;bring to,&#8217; the stamp, the roar, and the shake of the stick, with the never-failing objurgation,
				were resorted to, and invariably with the same results. The passage up to Cairo averages three
				days, but vessels have been known to be as many as nine. Seven, eight, nine days past; twelve, fourteen;
				yet as if by magic, Grand Cairo seemed to recede before them. No time had been lost by him,
				for the wind had been strong in their favor, and he scarcely allowed the crew to take the necessary
				rest. It was very odd how greatly had he been misinformed in the distance! The very maps too
				seemed leagued against him; his manifold measurings and calculations were of no apparent avail.
				At last, at rising on the morning-of the fifteenth day, he found himself at anchor off a strange tumble-down-looking
				town, which by signs the captain gave him to understand was the place of his destination.
				Could that be &#8216;Grand Cairo!&#8217; How odd! But then he was in a country of oddities; and on
				stepping ashore, he encountered a sun-burnt English-looking man gazing earnestly at the new arrival.</p>

				<p>&#8216;Is this Grand Cairo, Sir?&#8217; inquired the astonished novice.</p>

				<p>&#8216;Grand Cairo, Sir! Good <span class="special_name">God</span>, no! This is Kennah, a thousand miles beyond! Why, how the
				devil did you manage to get up here without knowing it? Do you speak Arabic?&#8217;</p>

				<p>&#8216;Not a word!&#8217;</p>

				<p>&#8216;Umph! What language then <em>did</em> you speak?&#8217;</p>

				<p>&#8216;No other than English; but when they stopped, I d&#8212;d their eyes soundly, and they seemed to
				understand very well what <em>that</em> meant, for they were up anchor and off in a jiffy!&#8217;</p>

				<p>The stranger, who spoke Arabic fluently, sought an explanation of the native captain, and the
				mystery was quickly solved.</p>

				<p>&#8216;How did you contrive to get up here, <span class="special_name">Ryis</span>, instead of stopping at Cairo?&#8217;</p>

				<p>&#8216;Why, Effendim, the Frank was the most impatient man in the world: no sooner did we stop to
				cook, to rest, or for the wind, than stick in hand, and raving with passion, he stamped on the deck,
				and with a gesture too imperious to be mistaken, shouted the only Arabic sentence which he seemed
				to know, which was &#8216;<em>Goddam</em> Ryis!&#8217;&#8212;and &#8216;<em>Inshallah!</em>&#8217; we got no rest, but were forced to work like
				devils. We passed Bourlac (Cairo) in the night, and <em>Allah Kherim!</em> here we are at a town which
				none of you Christians pass without stopping.&#8217;</p>

				<p>&#8216;<em>God-dam</em>&#8217; is very good Arabic for &#8216;go on;&#8217; and &#8216;Ry-i-s,&#8217; means &#8216;captain.&#8217; &#8216;G-d d&#8212;n your
				eyes!&#8217; however thoroughly English it may seem to cockneys, is very tolerable Arabic for &#8216;Go on,
				captain!&#8217; (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en avant</em>.)</p>

			<p>&#8216;<cite>A Story of Sorrow and Crime</cite>&#8217; is an affecting monitory sketch, devoid of that mawkishness
			which is sometimes the characteristic of kindred performances. The writer&#8217;s reflections

			go a little farther, where you will find eternal rest. Whatever you may have to encounter
			between the cradle and the grave, every moment is big with innumerable events, which

			types: &#8216;I met not long after in New-York a man who had just been induced to rent the
			very hotel in Kentucky which was the scene of the reverses I have been describing.
			Aware that I had at one time kept the establishment, he was anxious to know my opinion
			of its pecuniary promise. &#8216;I don&#8217;t expect to make much the first year,&#8217; said he; &#8216;I shall
			be satisfied if I &#8216;realize&#8217; all expenses. But do you think I shall clear myself the first year?&#8217;
			&#8216;I haven&#8217;t the slightest doubt of it,&#8217; I replied; &#8216;<em>I cleared myself</em> before the first six months
			were up, and was d&#8212;d <em>glad</em> to get off so; and I rather guess that <em>you&#8217;ll</em> be too, in about
			half that time.&#8217; And he was!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> Could there be a more affecting picture than that
			of a fond mother learning for the first time from the tell-tale prattle of her little ones that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page607" title="607">&nbsp;</a>she is &#8216;given over to darkness and the worm&#8217; by her friends, who had disguised from her

			Boston,&#8217; went &#8216;a-travelling abroad;&#8217; and while in Florence, called on <span class="special_name">Powers</span> the sculptor,
			with a design to &#8216;patronize&#8217; him a little. After looking at his &#8216;Greek Slave,&#8217; his &#8216;Eve,&#8217; and
			other gems of art, he remarked that he &#8216;thought they&#8217;d look a good &#8217;eal better if they had
			some clothes on. I&#8217;m pretty well off,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;and ha&#8217;n&#8217;t a chick nor child in the
			world; and I thought I&#8217;d price a <em>statty</em> or two. What&#8217;s the damage, now, for that one
			you&#8217;re peckin&#8217; at?&#8217; &#8216;It should be worth from four to five thousand dollars, I think,&#8217; answered
			<span class="special_name">Powers</span>. &#8216;What! five thousand dollars for <em>that &#8217;are</em>! I cal&#8217;lated to buy me a
			piece of <em>stattyary</em> before I went home, but <em>that&#8217;s</em> out of the question! <em>Hasn&#8217;t stattyary riz
			lately?</em> How&#8217;s paintin&#8217;s here now?&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Just</span> complaints are made by our city contemporaries
			of the exorbitant rates of postage upon weekly periodicals. Mr. <span class="special_name">Willis</span> complains,
			in the &#8216;<cite>New-Mirror</cite>&#8217; weekly journal, that country postmasters charge so much
			postage on that periodical by mail, that in many cases it would make the work cost to its
			country subscribers something like ten dollars a year! All postage in this country is at
			too high a rate; and so long as it remains so, the law will continue to be evaded. &#8216;Cheating
			<span class="special_name">Uncle Sam</span>&#8217; is not considered a very heinous offence. There is nothing one robs with so
			little compunction as one&#8217;s country. It is at the very worst robbing only eighteen millions of
			people. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> lines sent us in rejoinder to the stanzas of &#8216;C. W. D.,&#8217; in a late issue,
			would not be <em>original</em> in our pages; nor could we hope to have many <em>new</em> readers for them,
			after they have appeared in, and of course been copied from, that exceedingly pleasant
			and well-edited daily journal, the <cite>Boston Evening Transcript</cite>. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Hauffman</span>, the German
			poet, was recently expelled from the Prussian dominions, and all his works proscribed
			thenceforth. &#8216;Served him right;&#8217; for in one of his works appears the &#8216;word following, to
			wit:&#8217; &#8216;<em>Sleuerverweigerungsverfassungsmassigberechtig</em>!&#8217;&#8212;meaning a man who is exempt
			by the constitution from the payment of taxes. &#8216;Myscheeves thick&#8217; must needs follow
			such terrific words. &#8216;We have heard,&#8217; says a London critic, in allusion to this jaw-breaker,
			&#8216;of a gentleman, a member of the <em>Marionettenschauspielhausengesellschaft</em>, who was said to
			be an excellent performer on the &#8216;<em>Constantinopolitanischetudelsackpfeife</em>!&#8217;&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> owe
			a word of apology to our friends the publishers, for the omission of notices which we
			had prepared of their publications, and which are crowded out by our title-page and index,
			that were forgotten until the last moment. We shall &#8216;bring up arrears&#8217; in our next.</p>
